  "Lore": "King Agamemnon brought his fury to bear against gilded Troy, for Prince Paris had stolen his Helen, his wife, whose beauty rivaled that of Athena and Aphrodite. To famed Achilles, invincible warrior, the king gave command of a thousand ships.\\n\\nAcross stormy seas and salted beach, soldiers sieged the city. Arrow and stone, blade and barb bounced from Achilles’ skin. Bathed as a babe in the River Styx by his Nereid mother, his hide was hardened, imperviously made. Through every charge, every death-defying battle, Achilles was at the fore. Troy hung poised to crumble.\\n\\nUntil Agamemnon gave slight to the mighty myrmidon. In grave offense, Achilles pulled his forces from the field. Hector, boldest, bravest, eldest of the Trojan princes seized the chance to push the Greeks to the sea. Water’s reflection mirrored scorching sails as Hector fired their ships. All seemed lost until Achilles rose to meet him. Fierce and fast the two titans fought, but Hector’s spear felled Achilles fair. Though Patroclus, it was, in the armor of Achilles, not Achilles who lay dead.\\n\\nWrathful at the loss of his faithful friend, Achilles donned armor newly-made and challenged Hector alone. Spear and blade and amor rang, but Achilles could not be harmed. Hector, prince of Troy, died in battle that day.\\n\\nParis, brother lost, tearful-eyed, let arrow loose, guided by divine envy. For there were Gods that could not suffer Achilles to survive. Straight and true the arrow flew and harpooned Achilles’ heel, where his mother held him when submerged. The wound was deep, his weakness found, Achilles met his end.\\n\\nA decade thence, from Hades’ depths, Achilles has been drawn. Armored now, upon the heel, revenge his only aim. For envious Gods stole from him his glory and his life. Now they tremble at the wrath of the man who cannot be harmed.",

  "Lore": "There are few elements as destructive or as purifying as fire. Agni, God of Fire, is the embodiment of both of these qualities, with a head for each.\\n\\nThough the source of his origin warrants debate - for there are many tales of his parentage ranging from two simple sticks rubbed together, to the cosmic energy that made all things at the beginning of time - Agni is a pivotal and important God with many duties to the Pantheon. He is the twin brother to Indra, God of the Heavens and Rains and chief among warriors. Conversely, Agni is chief among priests, acting as messenger between mortals and Gods. Every Hindu ritual and prayer is performed in front of a fire of some kind, so Agni carries the words and sacrifices, traveling between the Earth and the Heavens. He is welcome in every home and every hearth and much beloved by the Faithful.\\n\\nThrough his flames, Agni provides heat and light, but also cleanses impurities. Smoke from his pyres create the air and hold the Heavens aloft. The sun, a source of fire itself, brings life-giving energy to the world, and his lightning streaks the sky during storms.\\n\\nFor all his kindness and service, Agni has two faces. One is the face of kindness and purity, turned towards the people and Gods. His other face, grim and resolute, guides the God of Fire, to play his role in the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction, to burn and blacken all the atrocities of the world to ash.",

  "Lore": "It is said that history is written by the victors, but what happens when the victors say nothing? Everything that came before would be lost. Events, mythology, even identity. The victors – the survivors – could become anyone. Even Gods. Ah Muzen Cab is suspiciously devoid of a past, but the God of Bees enjoys the privileges of worship and ceremony. Privileges that, perhaps, he stole.\\n\\nLong ago, the sky was propped above the land by four beings, the Bacab. They endured their task without complaint, and for their service, were honored by the Mudmen beneath. In truth, the Bacab were prisoners, shackled by duty. Then, a great flood consumed the earth. Seizing their chance, the Bacab fled and the sky crashed into the rising sea. Into that terrible storm they vanished, never to be seen again.\\n\\nAs the seas retreated, new Bacab stepped in to hold the sky aloft. The land reemerged, and from it mankind was born. Gods appeared; patrons of the sustaining forces of life, like agriculture and fertility. And the bee, creator of honey, used to sweeten food, as medicine for the sick, and to produce mead for rituals, was revered, and Ah Muzen Cab arrived, as if from nowhere, as their God.\\n\\nNow, as the greatest war between the heavens clashes on earth, what will remain when the dust has settled? Who will be the victor that writes history? If Ah Muzen Cab was, indeed, one of the original four Bacab, he survived the end of the world once and became a God. What power will he seize this time when the new world is made?",

Yet, further into the black below, at the inkiest recesses can be found the horrific ninth hell. Here dwells a deity of true evil, gloating over each corpse he’s claimed with macabre glee, and relishing the moment more of these lesser souls are his. He is Ah Puch, the mightiest lord of the ninth hell.\\n\\nWhen night falls, Ah Puch roams the land, crowned by a wreath of human eyes, gruesome skull face bared for all to witness, accompanied by the shriek of ghostly owls. All that live are his for the taking. If Ah Puch finds a human in the night, he kills and drags the unfortunate into endless oblivion. Only those already wracked by his servants, those caught in gut-wrenching wailing, moans of agony, and fits of mania are safe from his touch.\\n\\nHide now, all men and Gods, for the age of eternal night has come. Ah Puch will reap anything that lives. There is great vacancy left in the nine hells, and the Horrific God of Decay wishes only to fill it.",

Universally, she is adored. \\n\\nLess so are her brothers, namely Susano-o, bringer of storms, whose jealousy of his sister’s popularity drove him to burn her golden rice fields and shatter the sacred looms of her people. Grief stricken at the destruction, Amaterasu sealed herself inside a deep cavern. Her people suffered and the realm fell into crushing darkness. \\n\\nFor an unknown time, she stayed there, hidden away from the atrocities of the world. Until, one day, came a thumping from outside. At first, she tried to ignore it, but curiosity called. Moving aside the great stone sealing the cavern, she peered cautiously out, only to stare into a polished bronze mirror. Blinded by her own reflection, Amaterasu was forced to creep further out to find the source of the sound. Hands grabbed her from either side and pulled her free of the cave. Gathered around were hundreds of friends and loved ones. Atop a wide tub danced Usume, Goddess of Mirth, creating the erratic drumming to the joy of all. Amaterasu smiled and light came back to the world. \\n\\nSeeing all those that depended on her, all those that loved her, Amaterasu vowed never again to hide away from calamity. She would, instead, face it, just as the dawn rises each new day.",

Weapons equally as sharp!\\n\\nAs a son of Ra, Anhur, and his sister Bastet, rode in the golden barge their father sailed across the sky each day. They protected the ship at dawn and dusk from the world serpent, Apep, who lurked at the horizon. Courageous, formidable, and above all, intelligent, Anhur defended the vessel with his spear and wits, outsmarting and distracting the serpent until feral Bastet delivered a killing blow.  With Apep gone, Ra became Pharaoh, Bastet, the Goddess of Cats and Women, and Anhur donned the mantle of the God of War.  This is how he became known as the Slayer of Enemies.\\n\\nAs time went on, another feline Goddess, Menhet, ran away from the Pantheon, spurning Ra. Anhur vowed to bring her back from the distant lands of Nubia to appease his father, but when he finally caught up with Menhet, he was enraptured and fell in love. He tied a rope to her neck and led her home, where he requested Menhet become his wife, a boon Ra happily granted.\\n\\nFor Egyptians, warfare is more than bloody battle, it's a means to break the chains of tyranny. Anhur can be found at the head of any charge, crushing corruption and leading the people to freedom. While his spear is deadly, Anhur is cunning and clever, able to outmaneuver opponents in ways they least expect.",

From that union, Anubis was born. Osiris cared for Anubis as his own, but when Osiris was murdered by his evil brother, Set, Anubis embalmed his adopted father and mummified the corpse so he would not rot. This preservation passed down to the Faithful, for if it was good enough for the Gods, it was good enough for man.\\n\\nNone enter the abyss of the Underworld without first being tested by Anubis. When corpses are preserved, he is the embalmer. When time for judgment comes, he is the final arbiter. In his realm, he keeps legendary weighing scales. On one side, the massive weight of Ma’at – truth and order. On the other side, he places the heart of the deceased. Should the weight of Ma’at prove infinitely heavier than that of the heart, Anubis casts the soul deep into the darkness of the Underworld, where it is forgotten, never to be reborn.",

For their worship, tides remain calm, rivers contained, and rainfall for crops plentiful. It was not always like this, however. Long ago, Ao Kuang grew greedy and expected greater sacrifices. When they were not given, he sent floods, tidal waves, and devastating storms, striking so much fear into the people they dared not speak of this violence to the Jade Emperor. Ao Kuang enjoyed his total control.\\n\\nThen came Sun Wukong to his undersea palace seeking a weapon for his famous journey to the West. Despite the offer of other weapons, Sun Wukong took the Ruyi Jingu Bang, an immense pillar that aided in controlling the tides. It was believed none could even lift it, but Sun Wukong spun it with ease. As if this were not humiliating enough, Sun Wukong demanded other gifts of armor, shoes, and helm, all of which Ao Kuang was forced to supply.\\n\\nNext, the demigod boy Nezha, playing in a stream, inadvertently shook Ao Kuang’s palace. Annoyed, the Dragon-God set forth his favorite scout to kill the child, but Nezha defended himself and the scout was slain. Furious, Ao Kuang ordered his third son to destroy Nezha, yet Nehza slew him as well. Completely outraged, Ao Kuang went to Nezha’s father and threatened to take the issue before the Jade Emperor, but Nezha tackled the Dragon-King and forced him to submit.\\n\\nSuch repeated shame and humiliation have both humbled Ao Kuang and tempered his fury to steely resolve. Long has he awaited his chance to rise again and exert dominance as a great Dragon-God of the Sea.",

So wondrous is she to behold that one look can inspire tears, desire, jealousy, and love. Yet, beneath her flawless exterior resides a heart burdened with insecurity.\\n\\nInattentive and hideous to look upon, her husband, Hephaestus, unknowingly leaves Aphrodite feeling lonely and worthless. She finds consolation in the arms of other men such as Ares, or validation by competing in any contest of beauty she encounters.\\n\\nAt a wedding attended by all the Gods, a golden apple appeared, inscribed with the words \"to the fairest.\" Immediately Aphrodite, her mother Hera, and sister Athena quarreled over it. Zeus elected Paris, Prince of Troy, to choose a victor. In exchange for being named the fairest, Aphrodite offered any woman in the world as his wife, so Paris agreed. However, he chose Helen as his wife, and their love began the catastrophic Trojan War.\\n\\nNow, a new war brews, but this one between Gods, not men. While the battlefield is no place for the fairest of all, Aphrodite recalls the destruction between the Greeks and Trojans. Perhaps, this time, her beauty can be used to stop a war instead of start one. Perhaps, this time, she will discover the beauty within.",

  "Lore": "There are none without admiration for Apollo, God of Music. He is brash, cavalier, and dauntless, with the power to bring hope to the hopeless and change the course of battle with a single arrow. Voices of soldiers, mothers, kings and emperors, even Gods rise in glorious melody in honor of him; and he, basking in their adoration, shines victoriously.\\n\\nThough Hera, Queen of Gods, challenged his very birth, sending the great serpent Pylos to slay Apollo, his twin sister Artemis, and their mother Leto, not even she could deny him victory. Merely four days old, Apollo, gifted with a legendary bow, slew the Gaia Serpent and defied Hera.\\n\\nIn his humble youth, Apollo was a cattle herder. The trickster God Hermes stole Apollo’s charges and led them to a nearby cave. From the shell of a tortoise and the body of a cow, he crafted the first Lyre. Apollo finally caught up with Hermes, saw the instrument, and simply had to have it, trading the rest of his cattle to Hermes for it. Years later, Hermes would send his son, Pan, to challenge Apollo in a contest of musical prowess, but Apollo soundly defeated the satyr with dexterous mastery of the Lyre.\\n\\nAs Apollo grew into his rightful place among the Gods, his victories mounted, and the songs of the Faithful were sung more and more in his name. Now, they raise their voices for Apollo to take the field as Gods clash. Never one to deny his adoring public, Apollo prepares for one last show.",

  "Lore": "Once, a beautiful and talented weaver of cloth and fabric, a single prideful mistake made a monster of Arachne for all time.\\n\\nWith loom and thread, there were none more skilled than the mortal Arachne. Viewers traveled leagues just to see her art. So wondrous and majestic were her tapestries, it was said the spinner must have been instructed by the patron Goddess of Weavers herself, Athena. To this comparison, Arachne proudly scoffed, claiming not even the Gods rivaled her talent at weaving.\\n\\nWhen Athena heard this, disguised as a crone, she visited Arachne and encouraged her to show proper respect to the Gods. Arachne dismissed the old woman and issued a challenge that no God, not even Athena, could weave better than she. Furious, Athena revealed herself and accepted the challenge.\\n\\nThey both set to the loom with fervor. Athena wove a glorious tapestry depicting her battle with Poseidon over the city of Athens. Her detail and imagery were exquisite. Yet Arachne’s weavings depicted Zeus in his many infidelities with mortals. So flawless, so lifelike was her artistry, not even Athena could refute the skill, nor could she contain her anger at such a sleight. Violently, she tore Arachne’s tapestry and pressed a finger to Arachne’s forehead. Twisting in anguish, Arachne fell to the ground as additional legs grew from her body, screaming as she transformed into the first spider.\\n\\nIt was an act of anger and pity, a lesson and a curse, for spiders are the greatest of weavers, and Arachne, in particular, was to weave for all time, but none could doubt the consequence for Arachne’s pride. Still, within her twisted heart, Arachne never forgave Athena, consumed by a dark hatred that can be sated only by the destruction of the Gods.",

He represents everything they fear and despise: war, strife, chaos, and murder. It’s said that the sky darkens when Ares takes the field. That he rides to battle on a chariot drawn by fire-breathing steeds and delights only in the clash of battle and smell of bloodshed.\\n\\nAres is not loved by his father. Zeus has many sons, but only two with his wife Hera. However, the thunder God has long suspected Hera of having an affair that led to the birth of Ares, perhaps as revenge for all of Zeus’ infidelity. For this, Zeus is disgusted by him.\\n\\nAres is not loved by his sister. Athena and Ares are both Gods of War. Where Ares represents violence, force, and slaughter, Athena is the embodiment of intelligence, strategy, and leadership. Ares is quick to act and leave a bloody trail. Athena is thoughtful and careful with lives. Often they have been on the opposite sides, most notably at the Battle of Troy, where Athena viciously wounded him and forced Ares to retreat.\\n\\nAres is the lover of the Goddess of Beauty. Though Aphrodite is married to Ares’ brother, Hephaestus, Ares takes what he wants, and Aphrodite gives in willingly. Their union created offspring almost as terrible as Ares himself: Phobos and Deimos, Fear and Terror.\\n\\nAres is loved only by the Spartans, who revere the God for his masculinity, his merciless warrior spirit, and tenacity against all odds. The Spartans, however, know the unpredictable fury of their patron, and bind his statues in chains. This is, in part, to prevent Ares’ spirit of victory from escaping Sparta, and a vain effort to keep the God of War contained.",

  "Lore": "Armed with a magical bow, Artemis is the unrivaled Goddess of the Hunt!\\n\\nDaughter of Zeus and Leta, Artemis and her twin brother Apollo are products of Zeus’ infidelity to his wife Hera. Insulted, Hera cursed Leta while she was pregnant, forbidding her to give birth on land or sea. Fortunately, she found an island that did not touch the ocean floor, so it was neither land nor sea, and thus bore her children. Artemis was born first, then miraculously aided as midwife in the birthing of her brother.\\n\\nArtemis spent her childhood in the hills and forests, training with her bow and hunting beasts. As she grew older and more beautiful, she also grew proud and ruthless when slighted or dishonored, especially against those that claimed to be better hunters than she. Adonis boasted this very thing and Artemis sent a wild boar to skewer him. The twin demigods Otos and Ephialtes, who could not be killed except by each other, threatened to kidnap Artemis and force her to marry one of them, but were tricked when Artemis, appearing as a doe, dashed between them. As they thrust with their spears they impaled each other. Finally, Actaeon, after peeping at Artemis while she bathed, was transformed into a stag and devoured by his own hunting dogs. Such is the wrath of Artemis.\\n\\nHer name is invoked by hunters seeking prey and by midwives during childbirth. Sacrifices are made in her name before a new military campaign. Adolescent girls are sent to her shrine to serve for one year. Beautiful, deadly, and chaste, Artemis is a focused woman and a fearsome warrior.",

Straightening slowly, like aged men, trees and fauna of the underbrush, now free of snow-weight, reach for the sun. It is spring; the world awakens from darkness and death to grow green again. Her hibernation ends. Coat wet with fresh rain, Artio, Goddess-Bear, roars into the chill morning air.\\n\\nShe is guardian of the cycle. Not the passage of time, but the balance of things. There is no spring without winter, no death without life, no darkness without light, no goodness without evil. Nature declares these opposites into law and Artio is the enforcer.\\n\\nAmong the ursine she runs, sometimes in the shape of a woman, lithe and wild, sometimes as a bear, brown and fierce. Nowhere in the forest do there stand shrines in her name, for Artio is less worshipped and more respected. Perhaps, instead, she looms overhead, a constant presence in the twinkle of the stars, a connection of glistening light; the constellation Ursa Major.\\n\\nAnd now there is war. None could know peace without war, victory without defeat, glory without failure. Artio must join those that fight if only to enforce the cycle of things. Nothing and no one defies the laws of nature like a God.",

The first crave the clash of steel and smell of slaughter, the latter know the wisdom of justice, the kindness of mercy, and that life should never be taken wantonly. These different warriors seek different Gods. Ares, God of War revels in the bloodletting, but his sister, Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, is patron to those who fight with dignity, and only when there is no other alternative.\\n\\nFavored daughter of Zeus, wise as ten thousand scholars, just as the scales themselves; Athena is a paragon of incorruptible virtue, and worshipped with righteous fervor. So revered is she that Athens, greatest city in all the world, is named for her, and regal temples adorn the countryside in her honor, each tended by loyal priestesses. To Athena, a life is a precious thing that need not be wasted in frivolous battle. Bloodthirsty Ares, on the other hand, is reviled by their father and chained by his ravenous subjects.\\n\\nAt the Siege of Troy, Ares disobeyed Zeus and joined with the battle, fighting for the mortal Trojans. Athena rose to stop him, indirectly championing the Greeks, but directly keeping the order of divine law. Their fierce battle clashed in unspeakable proportions, ending only when Ares limped from the battle field, cowed by his sister and rival. With Ares diminished, the tide of the war shifted and the heroes of the Greek Army toppled Troy.\\n\\nIn times of war, prayers are sent to both Gods. Ares, for bloodstained victory, Athena for honor, valor, and the wisdom to fight with dignity. Make no mistake, these are times of war, and Ares has already answered the call to arms. Athena, ever cautious with lives, goes to battle without eagerness, but solemn necessity, for the Goddess of Wisdom knows honor is for the living. The dead have no need of it.",

As Queen of the Night, she is known; the Goddess of the Moon, Awilix.\\n\\nThey say the sun is her lover, and from his light does she shine, but those that say so have never beheld her. Left unrestrained, the sun burns skin, scorches the land, blinds the eyes. Moonlight does no such thing. Like soft white petals it blankets the night, casting the world into mystical illumination. Never has it brought calamity or ruin, only the chance to see where once there was none. She is no different. Her mysterious radiance needs no other to shine.\\n\\nThese days, the night is less welcoming. Those loyal followers, the jaguars, whose whispered roars bellow into the silence of her domain, prowl at her command. While it is, no doubt, beyond the understanding of mortals, the very moonlight is threatened. A war unlike any before it would end all things. For once that pale white will glimmer on the ugliness of bloodshed, for the night belongs to Awilix.",

  "Lore": "It is an old story. Perhaps the oldest story there is. In the dark woods, there is a witch called Baba Yaga. Sometimes she is a mother. Sometimes she is a daughter. Sometimes she is cruel and sometimes, kind. But always, Baba Yaga is cunning. And there is always a price to pay for dealing with her, if you are brave enough – or desperate enough – to seek her out.\\n\\nIt is said that Baba Yaga waits for travellers in her house atop its gnarled chicken legs, behind a fence made of human bones. If you are brave enough to pass through the fence and enter the house you will see her stretched out across the interior, looming over her stove, or reaching out from one corner to another. Or, if you are in the woods late at night, you might see her flying overhead in her mortar and pestle and the hear the thunderous tramp of the chicken-legged house as it pursues its mistress.\\n\\nRegardless, she is an ugly creature with a long nose and cruel, iron teeth, and her eyes gleam with malice. But despite her inherent malevolence, she does not interfere with others without first being approached – or provoked. If you are foolish enough to seek her, she might well punish you for your effrontery before aiding you, or aid you and then tear you to pieces because it amuses her to do so. And sometimes, very rarely, she helps without harm.\\n\\nBut only when it suits her to do so.\\n\\nNow, as the world shudders on its axis and new horrors rise, Baba Yaga stirs in her long isolation. The gods have ignored her warnings for long enough, and if they will not ask for her help willingly, she will find a way to force them to do so…",

  "Lore": "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you may die. None adhere more vigorously to this creed than Bacchus, the Roman God of Wine, lewd behavior, and madness.\\n\\nAfter spending much of his formative years with his impressively intoxicated mentor Solinus, whom Bacchus loves like a father, the God of Wine is now a wanderer and teacher. He’s journeyed across all of Asia, through India, and finally back to Rome, spreading the “Mysteries of the Vine,” a ritual involving incredible amounts of wine to lower inhibitions, freeing one from social constraints, oppression of gender, sexual taboos, and the stresses of life. Quite the successful ritual, if ever there was one.\\n\\nMuch of this ritual seems to have come from Solinus, who is widely known to have vast, secret knowledge and the ability to predict the future, though only while completely drunk. The king Midas, covetous of this knowledge, captured Solinus, endeavoring to extract it by providing the scholar the finest food, drink, and entertainment he could muster. Bacchus finally tracked down his mentor in the court of Midas and discovered him well fed and cared for. Quickly, Midas lied, claiming Solinus had been lost and the king had taken him in. Seeing through the ruse, Bacchus offered the monarch a boon. Midas asked that anything he touched be turned to gold. Without hesitation, Bacchus granted this. He tested his new gift on a twig and stone and found them turned completely to gold. Elated, Midas called a feast, but found his food turned to gold in his hands and his daughter solidified at his touch. Starving and crazed, Midas begged Bacchus to remove the “gift.” Bacchus acquiesced, allowing the greedy king to wash his hands in the Pactolus river. As the golden touch left his hands, the river sands transformed to glittering gold.\\n\\nOf course, the product of continuous overindulgence in alcohol and deviant behavior, Bacchus could simply be insane.",

  "Lore": "A horrendous demon with a bottomless appetite for human flesh, Bakasura is a nightmare come to life.\\n\\nAfter committing countless atrocities, Bakasura has demonstrated no end to his depravity, no limits to his brutality, no sating his desire to slurp human meat, crunch bone, and guzzle hot blood. So many are his vile victories over mankind that they cannot be relayed here, yet it his defeat at the hands of a man that is worth the telling.\\n\\nAccording to the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, the famous Pandava brothers were traveling in exile with their mother, Kunti, when they came to the village Ekachakra. Disguised as brahmins, they sought alms from the villagers in order to sustain themselves. They soon learned that a demon, Bakasura, was living outside the village, devouring the people as they passed through the woods. The chief went to the demon and begged that the feasting stop. In return, a cart of food would be sent to Bakasura each day. Bakasura consumed not only the provisions, but the person that brought the cart as well.\\n\\nAfter hearing this tale from a weeping woman whose son would bear the cart on the morrow, Kunti declared that her son Bhima, who possessed impossible strength and had slain demons before, would take the cart instead, as repayment to the kindness the villagers had shown their family.\\n\\nOnce in the forest, Bhima nonchalantly ate the food intended for Bakasura. Furious, Bakasura threatened to eat Bhima, which he just laughed off, goading the demon to attack him. All day they battled until Bhima finally slew the demon, tied him to the cart and dragged the body back to the village, where the people celebrated the victory in bewilderment.\\n\\nHunger, however, is a demon that cannot be defeated and, inevitably, Bakasura’s disgusting rumble will rise again, now more ravenous than ever and ready to feed.",

They are regal, nonchalant, and insatiable. Though, as much as they languish in the sun and rumble with purrs of pleasure, cats are agile and deadly hunters. Mercilessly, they cull the populations of invasive vermin and stinging scorpions, protecting the home from vile invaders. Perhaps, the most troublesome enemy of the cat is the serpent, and there was no greater snake in the world than the horrendous Apep.\\n\\nCircling the world along the horizon line, Apep’s scaly girth waited in ambush each morning for Ra to rise and bring light to the world. To fend off this beast, Ra kept the company of his daughter, Bastet. Since time began, as Ra lifted into the Eastern sky, Bastet would spit and howl, claws bared against the treacherous Apep. Countless battles were fought, countless mornings faced uncertainty, until, at last, Bastet tore the foul serpent apart.\\n\\nWith her greatest enemy gone, Bastet is free to prowl as she pleases. Now, she is the guardian of home and hearth,  idol to women - especially those desiring children and exploring their sensuality - and patron of arts, wine, and any occasion of revelry. Like any cat, though, Bastet can still pounce without warning, shredding her enemies once her claws come out.",

She favors only those for whom war is life; for that is where she thrives - not on the steps of hallowed basilicas or in whispered prayers, but in the blood-soaked mud, among the breathless armored troops, in the roar of victory.\\n\\nWhen Rome was young, Bellona ran with her armies, conquered her enemies, made her strong. As Rome aged and began to crumble, she fought only with her strongest and most cunning of worshippers, Lucius Cornelius Sulla.\\n\\nSulla rose through the ranks by accomplishing impossible deeds of heroism and ruthless prowess. His enemies feared him, his soldiers loved him, and everywhere he went, Bellona rode with him. Together they quelled the Germanic hordes, they broke the Social War, they sacked Athens. Sulla was utterly undefeatable, and it was the Goddess of War that made him so.\\n\\nBut the Roman Senate moved to displace Sulla and end his rise to glory.\\n\\n\"March on Rome,\" Bellona quietly urged, \"and you shall rise as no other.\"\\n\\nEmboldened, Sulla commanded his legions and took the city streets, Bellona at the fore, slaughtering the gladiator-slaves that stood against them. The Senate buckled. They cast the vote. Sulla became the first life-long dictator of Rome.\\n\\nDuring Sulla's reign, Bellona was worshipped for the Goddess she was. But Sulla had grown old. His wars were over. Bellona moved on, and Rome forgot.\\n\\nBut the forgotten are not gone. Gods clash in titanic conflict. It is in war she thrives. No one will forget Bellona the Goddess of War this time.",

These traits – and worse - he inherited from his sire, the demon bird Seven Macaw.\\n\\nSeeking to end Seven Macaw's entire lineage, the Hero Twins tracked Cabrakan by his quaking footfalls. They found him in a valley, surrounded by great peaks, shattering rock into dust.\\n\\n\"How mighty you are,\" they told him, playing to his pride.\\n\\n\"I am,\" he boasted.\\n\\n\"Can you shatter that distant mountain?\" they asked.\\n\\n\"Of course,\" Cabrakan roared.\\n\\n\"You must be hungry,\" the Hero Twins offered.\\n\\n\"Always!\"\\n\\nAnd so they shot a bird from the sky for the giant to feast upon, yet as they turned the carcass over the flame, Hun-apu coated it with poisonous mud.\\n\\nWithout a thought, Cabrakan devoured the feast and rose, but already the poison had taken him. Teetering, losing sight, the Earthsunder collapsed. Mountains crumbled a final time. The valley became his tomb.\\n\\nYet vengeance is a cycle. Blood for blood, and a Titan is not so easily slain. The destroyer of mountains cannot be buried beneath stone, and Cabrakan's pained slumber is at an end. Bursting free, he now thunders across the field of war, seeking the Twins that played him the fool. Why stop at mountains when Cabrakan can destroy Gods.",

Whether beast, mortal, or God matters not, only satisfying the unquenchable thrum in his veins for the boiling blood of another creature. But there is never enough. There will never be enough. So Camazotz, bat-god, whose bestial form matches that of his nocturnal servants, lurks in the darkness, waiting only to feed.\\n\\nOnce before, when the hero twins, Xbalanque and Hunahpu ventured to the Xibalba, stumbling blindly into the blackness of his cave, did Camazotz defeat a God. Finding themselves surrounded by a swarm of leathery bats, screeching and flapping with frenzied glee, the hero twins cowered and hid, hoping for dawn to light their way out. Patient, as always, Camazotz waited. Hunahpu, unable to hold out, lifted his head from concealment to check for light. Camazotz leapt, sliding through the blackness like a dagger through skin, and snatched Hunahpu’s head from his neck. Victorious, he presented his prize as a trophy to the other underworld Gods. However, come the morning light, Xbalanque fashioned a new head for his brother from a gourd and the two escaped while Camazotz was away.\\n\\nLong has Camazotz hung from his perch, watching as Gods clash and spill their sweet blood upon the earth. He’s waited, ever watchful, ever patient, for the moment to strike. Now that the moon has risen, and night has come, Camazotz has disappeared into the darkness. When next he’s seen, there will be blood on his fangs.",

Cernunnos is master here, and although he has much to offer, he will not tolerate greed.\\n\\nTime turns on the Sacred Wheel, Spring to Summer, Summer to Autumn and Autumn at last to Winter. Cernunnos was there at the shaping of the wheel, born of the womb of the All Mother before Gods were Gods, when the land was shapeless. This wheel is not of his making. He is both master of it and slave to it, transforming with the seasons like the world beneath his feet. He bears a heavy metal torc around his neck as a permanent pledge of loyalty to this cycle of life and death that only he can drive.\\n\\nOnce, it was said, there was no break between his realm and this world. They were the same. Perhaps a time will come when the world shall once again be his. Then, all can walk among the whispering leaves. So long as they remain humble. For the arrogant, Cernunnos hunts. What are these other Gods? Guest or prey?",

Without rain, this world would be barren and all living things would turn to dust. Thus is the power of Chaac, God of Rain. But, like all great power, it did not come without cost.\\n\\nIn mankind’s earliest days there were no farmers, so they starved beneath the sun. For days, Chaac sought a way to feed them. Deep in the mountains he discovered a golden boulder and cleft it with his mighty axe. Within was Maize, the crop that would change the Mayan people forever, and Chaac was worshipped and adored for it.\\n\\nDrunk with pride, Chaac sought the object of his deepest desire, the wife of his brother. For a time, their affair remained secret, but that was not to last. Chaac’s brother, the Sun God, discovered them. Without a word, she dutifully returned to her husband and Chaac, realizing what he had done, let her go, but a rift formed between the two brothers that would never heal. In his grief, Chaac drove his axe into the sky, and from the wound tears of regret fell.\\n\\nSince then, Chaac has chosen a life free of pride and selfishness, devoting himself only to mankind. As a reminder of his greatest failing, he continues to cleave the heavens, washing the land in sustaining waters. Thus do crops grow. Thus do the people survive. Thus is the power of Chaac, God of Rain.",

Such is the tale of Chang’e, Goddess of the Moon.\\n\\nAmong the immortals that lived in the Heavens, Chang’e was the most elegant dancer, like a dove on windswept currents. She drew the affection of the hero archer, Hou Yi, and the two were soon married. Everything was perfect.\\n\\nYet, beneath the Heavens, all was not well. Ten suns, the ten children of the Jade Emperor, rose to scorch the earth and boil the seas. Brave Hou Yi, bow in hand, shot nine from the sky, sparing only one. Though the world was saved, the Jade Emperor was furious his children were killed. In punishment, Hou Yi and Chang’e were made mortal.\\n\\nChang’e grew melancholy and danced no more. To restore their status in the Heavens, Hou Yi found the Elixir of Immortality, but thieves came to steal it while he was hunting. Chang’e struggled to hide the Elixir, but, in the end, was forced to drink it. Too much for one person, the Elixir gave her immortality, but it also swept her into the sky.\\n\\nSince then, Chang’e has lived on the moon, forbidden to see her husband, a Jade Rabbit her only companion. Yet, the Earth is once again in peril, and Chang’e finds herself upon the mortal surface. Perhaps, this is a second chance. If only she can save the world without angering the Jade Emperor, she can at last reunite with her husband.",

Black against a blackening sky, the Great Mountain’s frozen peak loomed.\\n\\nIn the crannies and crevisses, in the darkened recesses of stone and ice, the denizens of nightmare crawled and squirmed. Silken shadows given form, withered hags of sorcerous witchcraft, leathery gargoyles, and skeletal fiends - all creeping ever upward, gathering for their unholy sabbath.\\n\\nNight at last swallowed light. Crystalline silence befell the summit. The wicked waited for their God. The pointed peak cracked and opened, two colossal bat-like wings spreading. He emerged, exultant.\\n\\nCreatures of every horror danced and cheered in twitches and fits, calling to their God. His jagged finger pointed and his minions of malice spewed forth to spread fear and death and darkness.\\n\\nChernobog, Lord of Darkness, grinned.",

Brutish, crude, and violent, the centaurs are not civilized creatures. Yet, Chiron is a scholar, a poet, an astrologer, and a teacher. And for all the wonder and glory of the world he tries to impart upon his illustrious students, Chiron, it seems, must constantly teach them the art of war. \\n\\nFame and legend are the hallmarks of his pupils. Perseus, who beheaded Medusa, Ajax, who battled bravely against Troy, and Achilles, who Chiron practically raised from infancy, all are figures of renown. But it is for their acts of violence, not art or science, for which songs are sung of these heroes. Chiron would prefer the world a more contemplative place where mankind adored nature and kindled bonds of friendship over scholarly discussions. \\n\\nThough, to his wizened eyes, the brink has been reached and the world he finds so fascinating tilts toward annihilation. Set aside are his books and scrolls, the easel and brush, and taken up are his bow and armor. On thunderous hooves Chiron gallops to the field. To save all that he holds dear, Chiron, the Great Teacher, will go to war.",

  "Lore": "Thrice born child of Gods and Kings, Cú Chulainn is legend brought to life. A warrior without equal that, alone, held an army at bay; a man of will and courage that resisted both the allure and wrath of the Morrigan; a figure of tragic prophecy, destined for greatness and an early grave. So many legends are there of his achievements they could be spoken for days and yet still more be told. And yet throughout his triumphs, his death loomed constant, foretold and certain.\\n\\nIn his early years, while still bearing the name Sétanta, he was already an impressive individual, catching the attention of King Conchobar with feats of strength and agility. Conchobar invited the boy to a feast hosted by the smith, Culann. Left unchained by mistake, Culann’s fearsome guard dog assailed Sétanta when he arrived. With only his bare hands, the boy defended himself and slew the beast. Ashamed, Sétanta swore to Culann he would personally train a new dog and would guard his home in the interim. Impressed, the druid Cathbad declared Sétanta would now be called the Cú Chulainn, the Hound of Culann.\\n\\nThis was the birth of a hero, but his death was yet bound in prophecy. Cathbad, the same druid that named him, promised a group of boys, “Any that take up arms this day will become legends.” Seeking greatness, Cú Chulainn raced off to find weapons before hearing more. He saw years of victory, of achieving the impossible, of becoming a legend before him. Cathbad, however, was devastated, for he knew that those that took up arms that day were also foretold to die young.",

  "Lore": "An arrow from the bow of Cupid, chubby little God of Love, will make anyone give in to passion and desire.\\n\\nCupid, as he was called by the Romans, is the son of Venus and Mars, or Aphrodite and Ares as they were known by the Greeks. He is the God of love and desire, flying about on feathery wings, shooting passion-tipped arrows at all the creatures of the earth. When struck with one of his arrows, man and beast alike fall in love with the next thing they see. Without Cupid’s steady aim, there would be no love in this world, which is precisely what happened when Cupid fell in love himself.\\n\\nPsyche was a mortal of astounding beauty, which made Venus venomously jealous. Venus ordered Cupid to sting her with an arrow, then arranged for Psyche to fall in love with a spider. Invisible, Cupid reluctantly went to Psyche as she slept, yet, she woke suddenly and saw right through Cupid’s invisibility. Surprised, Cupid cut himself on his own arrow and fell immediately in love with Psyche.\\n\\nFurious, Venus would not let Cupid marry Psyche, so Cupid stopped shooting arrows, people stopped falling in love and stopped worshipping Venus. Panicked, the Goddess of beauty relented and Cupid went back to work. Psyche was whisked to a secret location. Cupid visited her only at night so she could not see who he was. Fearing him to be a terrible monster, Psyche waited for Cupid to fall asleep and lit a lantern. Surprised at what she found, she accidentally scraped one of Cupid’s arrows and fell in love with him.\\n\\nVenus was displeased and forbade Psyche to see her son, forcing her to complete a series of impossible challenges that Psyche overcame only with mystical help. Finally, Cupid begged Jupiter (Zeus) to intervene. Casually, he declared Psyche and Cupid could be together. Thus, Cupid fed Psyche the drink of ambrosia that made her immortal and the God of love got to live happily ever after.",

  "Lore": "Emperor Zhou’s desire for the Goddess Nu Wa was considered an obsession, perhaps even madness. She sent signs and missives to reject him, but Zhou would not be dissuaded. At night, he slipped into her temple and scrawled poetry across the walls espousing his undying love. This defilement could not go unanswered. Nu Wa summoned the most conniving and wicked Fox Spirit she could and thrust it upon the Emperor with intent to spiral his life into misery. Little did Nu Wa know what she had just unleashed.\\n\\nFor thousands of years the nine-tailed Fox spirit had lived, biding its time, honing its malicious appetites. Finally in human form, it assumed the irresistible guise of Da Ji, and to Emperor Zhou, she could do no wrong.\\n\\nWith free reign of the Empire and its people, Da Ji reveled in torture and malice. She took delight in their screams of pain as she danced to playful music composed at her command, the musicians trembling for every note.\\n\\nSo grievous did these atrocities grow that the people rose up and overthrew their ruler. They stormed the gates, toppled the throne, and pursued Zhou to his bed chamber, where the crazed emperor finally took his own life.\\n\\nYet, Da Ji managed to escape and conceal herself. Now she joins the fray, not to save the universe, nor empower her pantheon, but instead to soak up every last cry of anguish from her enemies.",

  "Lore": "It is said Rome wasn’t built in a day. Whether the sweeping arches of the Colosseum, the long stretch of the aqueducts, or the power the Servian Wall, none can truly claim they were the origin that “built” Rome. For as mighty as she has become, Rome might have never been were it not for the mischief of the Goddess Discordia.\\n\\nOnce known among the Greeks as Eris, the maligned Goddess of Strife, Discordia craved to unleash her full potential, to unravel the foundations of the mortals and deities that hated her. She found that opportunity through the vanity of others.\\n\\nConjuring a golden apple, Eris cast it forth. Upon it read the words ‘for the fairest.’ A phrase that would set Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite against one another. A phrase that would cause Paris to kidnap Menelaus’ wife, Helen. A phrase that would ignite the Trojan War.\\n\\nAs chaos swirled, as cities crumbled, as heroes both Greek and Trojan fell to each other’s blades and Gods grew to loathe one another, no one seemed to wonder from whence the golden apple came. It was masterful! Eventually, the Trojan War reached its peak, and Eris attached herself to the mortal Aeneus. She guided him safely from Troy, across the sea and wilderness, to the place where a new nation would be built. Here, Aeneus founded Rome.\\n\\nFree of the judgement she wore under the Greeks, bereft of the belittling glares of the other Gods, Eris was remade as Discordia. A Roman Goddess of importance and prominence. Indeed, Rome was not built in a day. It was the culmination of a plan for one Goddess to reinvent herself as more than she ever was.\\n\\nAnd all with one golden apple.",

Yet the true  source of the disaster proved to be an evil dragon. With seven companions, Erlang Shen ambushed the beast. Cowardly and quick the dragon slithered into the rapid river waters, but Erlang Shen captured it with a great chain and bound it beneath a shrine. Thus the floods subsided.\\n\\nWhen Sun Wukong’s troublesome antics drew the ire of the Jade Emperor, Erlang Shen faced the Monkey King on the battlefield. For every form Sun Wukong took, Erlang Shen transformed as well. Across sea and sky and land they battled. Thus was Sun Wukong sent fleeing for his life.\\n\\nWhen the people were plagued by demons and monsters, Erlang Shen slaughtered them to keep his countrymen safe. Three-bladed spear in hand and hunting dog at his side, no evil could threaten the innocent or the Empire. Thus, Erlang came to be loved and worshipped.\\n\\nA Goddess mother and a mere mortal father, he is of two worlds. He is both sage and a soldier, humble yet regal, his veins filled with the blood of men and the divine blood of his uncle, the Jade Emperor. Having risen above his forbidden origins, Erlang Shen has proven himself among the greatest of heroes in the Jade Empire. Perhaps that is why he now takes the field. No demon, nor dragon, nor even the Monkey King himself has stood against him and won. To save the people, to save the world, Erlang Shen will fight, and another legend will be born!",

In the frozen reaches of Asgard, beneath her mighty stone peaks, do they dwell, ever hammering to forge more gold jewelry, to carve more gleaming gems, to breathe curses into their finery.\\n\\nAmong these wretched kin is Fafnir, son of Hreidmar, with a swollen smithing arm and a ravenous hunger for violence, both of which are eclipsed by his avarice.\\n\\nOne Spring, Odin, Loki, and Honir visited Hreidmar’s realm, bearing an otter pelt they’d skinned on their journey. Horrified, Hreidmar entombed the Aesir, for the otter was, in truth, his third son. Freedom would not be theirs until Loki returned with the hide filled with gold.  Refusing to be outdone, the Trickster God, stuffed the pelt to bursting with the cursed treasure of Andvarri. Hreidmar, unaware of the maligned hoard, greedily exchanged the Aesir for the wealth. That night, curling his powerful arm, Fafnir strangled his father and vanished into the frosted night with the cursed gold.\\n\\nAnd so it was that madness took him. Paranoid his last brother would steal the treasure, Fafnir guarded it jealously while the curse whispered in his ear. Slowly, surely, twisted he became, scaled and nightmarish. His breath turned to poison, his maw, fanged, his demeanor, fouler. A dragon, he became. The very symbol of greed.\\n\\nFor centuries Fafnir kept no company, but the War of the Gods grows ever closer, and the clink of coin runs rampant; a bulging sack on the belt of every warrior. He craves every piece, and spares no thought to shed blood for the glittering gold.",

  "Lore": "Mortals must rely on the wisdom of the Gods, but never forget they are fallible. They can be petty, churlish, and worst of all, wrong. What are the consequences for their mistakes? They should have slain the wolf-beast Fenrir, but they chose instead to bind him. Despite the warnings and prophecies he would tear Odin apart at Ragnorok and devour the earth and sky, they did not end Loki's son. Now, terror roams free. It is unknown how, but Fenrir is Unbound.\\n\\nThrice they tried to bind him, each time convincing Fenrir that the chains were nothing more than a challenge for his strength, a test to see if he could shatter them. The first two God-forged fetters were easily broken beneath the beast’s terrible power, but the third was a ribbon, dwarf made, and Fenrir grew suspicious of the God’s intentions. As a show of faith, he demanded one of them place a hand in his mouth, and if the ribbon proved magical in nature, he would exact punishment. Brave, if foolish, Tyr put his fist in Fenrir’s maw as the ribbon was secured to the wolf’s leg. Fenrir strained and screamed, but could not break free, and in rage, he devoured Tyr’s hand.\\n\\nFor a time, Fenrir was forgotten, the dire prophecy just a memory. But they were all warned and the Gods did nothing. Fenrir is hungry now, the first hunter, an alpha among sheep, but no flesh will satisfy his need. It is revenge he craves, and now he is Unbound.",

Yet their queen, Freya, so irresistibly desirable, so uncompromising in warfare, make the Valkyries seem nothing more than plain paper dolls. She’s the object of desire for every God, every man, and the envy of every woman. Even the Frost Giants crave her for their own, often devising devious plans to trick or force her into marriage. But Freya is proud and strong, with the cunning to escape her enemies and ruthlessly retaliate. Every rose bears thorns, but this one wields swords.\\n\\nWere it up to her, Freya would have little to do with blood and blades. Her name literally means “the lady,” and none of more worthy of the title. She adores bright flowers, pleasant company, and the sweet lilt of a sad love song. She’s sensual and amorous, invoked by worshipers seeking to bear a child or find a lover. Ruler of the realm of Sessrumnir, a place much like Valhalla, where the souls of dead warriors spend eternity, Freya provides comfort and bliss to the fallen.\\n\\nOnce, Freya was married to the mysterious and elusive God, Od. Immediately following their wedding, Od went on a journey to distant and inhospitable lands. So long was he gone the Gods presumed him dead. Distraught and heartbroken, Freya spilled tears of gold and searched the globe for him. Finally, she discovered him ship-wrecked and twisted into a hideous sea monster. Melancholy but loyal, she stayed and comforted him. Though one night, while she slept, a daring hunter slew the beast Od had become. Moved by Freya’s utter despair, the Gods agreed to allow Od into Sussrumnir, despite the fact he had not died in battle, so he and Freya could remain together forever.",

With a wave of her hand, it was transformed into a boy, her son, and set him to guard the door as she finished washing. Shiva, the supreme being, returned and found this child doggedly blocking his path. Fearing the safety of his wife, Shiva drew his sword and cut him down.\\n\\n“This is your son!” Parvati cried. “You must save him!”\\n\\nHurriedly, Shiva replaced the head of the child with the wisest creature in the world, that of an elephant. Thus, was Ganesha truly born.\\n\\nGenerous, warm-hearted, and optimistic, Ganesha has assumed authority over the very thing his mother tasked of him - obstacles. For those whose hearts are filled with boastful arrogance, Ganesha challenges progress. Financial difficulties, faulty materials, and unhappiness plague their every action. But, for the honest, the hard working, Ganesha clears the way. A life of good fortune, bright skies, and joyous laughter. \\n\\nObstacles can be either placed or removed. So, to Ganesha all mortals pray when starting a new endeavor, that their path will be open and their future bright. That he may grant them success.\\n\\nOnly with reluctance has Ganesha joined the Battle of the Gods. Violence is the last obstacle the elephant-God would ever place. But these are not mortals that threaten existence. They are Gods, and it is time that Ganesha determined who should succeed, and who should fail.",

A lumbering giant, patient, deliberate, unmovable; he is Geb, God of Earth.\\n\\nWhen a mortal’s heart is weighed in the halls of Ma’at, Geb sits among the Gods in judgment. Those burdened with guilt and regret are claimed by Geb and dragged through the earthen crust to the underworld. Hearts free of such heaviness are taught words of power and ascend to the sky.\\n\\nAh, the sky.\\n\\nIt is but the one thing Geb longs for. In his eye, she is glorious sapphire, an unreachable object. But it was not always so. Once, the earth and sky were as one, Geb and Nut, Goddess of the Sky, locked in a lover’s embrace. Ra deemed their union unfit and sent Shu, God of Wind, between them. In his rage, Geb thundered and broke the earth, but for naught, Nut was now forever out of reach.\\n\\nThough his desire has not weathered with the ages, Geb has rested peacefully for time immemorial, nurturing Mankind through bountiful harvest and stable ground for pyramids and palaces. It is the clash of Gods upon his surface that stirs him. He has risen to war, though his motives are unclear. Does he fight to prevent the destruction of his realm, or will he seize the chance to shatter the wind and reunite the earth and sky? Whatever the outcome, the earth will always remain.",

  "Lore": "As a man, Guan Yu was the embodiment of loyalty, honor, and strength. As a God, he is a guardian of justice, a hero to the downtrodden, the Saint of War.\\n\\nIn the ancient times of the East, a great war between Three Kingdoms raged. The warlord Liu Bei, and his friends, Zheng Fei, and the mighty Guan Yu swore an oath of brotherhood in a mystical peach garden, vowing to create a new, righteous world. Together, they fought countless battles against the warlords Cao Cao and Sun Quan, and Guan Yu grew famous for his combat prowess and unwavering honor.\\n\\nDuring the war, Cao Cao captured Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Bei’s fate was uncertain, so he agreed to fight for Cao Cao under specific terms, chiefly that he would abandon Cao Cao if ever he learned the whereabouts of his sworn brother. Despite Cao Cao’s gifts and promises of wealth, when Liu Bei resurfaced, Guan Yu immediately went to his side. Years later, Guan Yu again faced Cao Cao on the battlefield as the warlord fled from his defeat at Red Cliffs. Guan Yu cut off Cao Cao’s retreat and obliterated his forces. Cao Cao, however, he spared and released, as a matter of honor.\\n\\nAfter his death, Guan Yu’s spirit remained at a holy shrine, coming to the aid of nearby villagers in need, battling the cruel and selfish. From all over the East, worshippers came to the shrine and burned incense to honor him. Such popularity led to Faith, and thus Guan Yu was raised as a God, deified a few hundred years later.\\n\\nNow, he embodies the virtues he lived by. His statues, wielding a massive guan dao, ward against evil. Red faced to represent loyalty, his likeness is carried by merchants as proof they can be trusted. If their cause is just, he leads armies to victory. Among the Gods of any Pantheon, there are few as deadly and none as righteous as Guan Yu.",

  "Lore": "War. It is an inevitable truth of Gods and Men. Harbinger of death and misery, of orphans and widows, of safety. It can be brutal and bloody, lacking all mercy, stripping away humanity, leaving only violent souls. Some believe war is about more than victory, some believe it is how that victory is won. That a warrior can be honorable, can treat his enemies with respect, that he can retain his humanity. When there is war to be fought, this is the kind of warrior Hachiman teaches.\\n\\nPregnant with her unborn son, Hachiman, the Empress Jingu led a fierce campaign against the forces that slew her husband. Fearing her child’s birth would slow the army’s advance, she tied bandages about her belly and held him within for 3 years, until the war was done. Each day, she prayed she would not lose the child, that he would be born strong. That he would be a God. As 8 banners descended from heaven, heralding his birth, her prayers were answered.\\n\\nHachiman embodies all a warrior should be. Temperate but fearless. Deadly not ruthless. Respectful, to enemies and allies alike. He understands that war cannot be stopped, so he teaches how war should be.\\n\\nEven in this, a war between Gods, Hachiman will retain his code. It is the humanity of the Gods that appeals to mortals, that makes them love and worship him. Should Hachiman lose even that, then he is no warrior. He is only war.",

  "Lore": "Inevitably, death sends everyone to Hades, God of the Underworld. In the end, he always gets his way.\\n\\nEldest son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, Hades was swallowed by his father as an infant along with five other siblings. Zeus, the youngest brother, escaped this fate and freed them once he’d grown strong enough to battle Cronus. Together, the six siblings defeated the Titans and banished them to the dark realm of Tartarus. Now the reigning Gods, Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades drew lots for dominion. Hades drew the Underworld.\\n\\nOf the few that have entered the Underworld and come back, all speak dismally of the place, never wishing to return. Yet Hades, himself, rarely leaves the subterranean realm, constantly seeking ways to grow the numbers of the dead.\\n\\nWhen he desired a wife, Hades captured the radiant Persephone, daughter of the Goddess Demeter. Concealed in the Underworld, none could reach her, so Demeter cursed the land with a great famine. The other Gods pleaded with her to end it lest she destroy mankind, but she would not relent until her daughter was returned. Hades finally let Persephone leave, though not before feeding her pomegranate seeds. Having consumed the fruit, she was bound forever to Hades and required to return to her husband once per year to eat of the seeds again. This, it is said, is a time of mourning and the cause of winter.\\n\\nWhile many fear death and view it as evil, in truth, Hades endeavors only to keep balance. He is stern but fair. As God of the Dead and the Underworld, he views his authority on this matter absolute, forbidding anyone to leave his realm and growing wrathful when disobeyed or when someone tries to cheat death or steal from him.\\n\\nFor everyone, death is unavoidable and service to Hades inevitable. Even the Gods.",

Now, the forces of the great river are at his command!\\n\\nThroughout history, no river has been the source of more nourishment or more destruction than China’s Yellow River. Its basin valley was the cradle that birthed Chinese civilization, feeding fields with water and millions of tons of collected sediments, which give the river its yellow hue. The river is also treacherous and prone to flooding, destroying shoreline settlements and drowning thousands.\\n\\nLong ago, Feng Yi, a mortal man living along the riverside, watched in dismay as a storm stirred the waters and gorged the banks. It would not be long before the mighty river consumed his village. Both humble and wise, Feng Yi tied rocks to his belt before casting himself into the waters. This act of sacrifice did more than appease the angry river, it promoted Feng Yi to Godhood over it. Thus, he became He Bo.\\n\\nMuch time passed, and He Bo grew proud of his great river, so proud that he declared the Yellow River the biggest body of water anywhere. A passerby asked if He Bo had seen the North Sea, but He Bo dismissed the comment, for heavy rains were falling and the river was roaring and full. As time wore on, thought of the North Sea tickled his mind, so he made the journey. There, the Dragon King of the Northern Sea warmly met him.  Viewing the endless expanse of water, He Bo was humbled and returned to his River wiser.\\n\\nFor He Bo, there are no greater virtues than wisdom and humility. With the force of the Yellow River at his command, He Bo will remind his enemies what it means to be humble.",

The watchman of Asgard is a sentry without equal in the Nine Realms and he maintains his eternal watch where the rainbow bridge meets the sky. With sharp eyes and keen hearing, Heimdallr stands guard over the halls of the gods, alert for the approach of any enemy as well as the first stirrings of Ragnarok.\\n\\nIt is said that Heimdallr requires less sleep than a bird, and can see for hundreds of leagues. His hearing is so sharp that he can perceive the soft whisper of growing grass, and the murmur of the dead. His trumpet, Gjallarhorn, can be heard across the Nine Worlds when blown. But it is not only his senses which make Heimdallr a superb sentinel.\\n\\nHe also possesses the gift of foresight, allowing him to predict his opponent’s moves before they occur and to sense the approach of inimical forces. As befitting one of the Aesir, he is a masterful combatant, and his foreknowledge gives him an edge over all but the most unpredictable – or skilled – of opponents.\\n\\nToo, it is whispered that Heimdallr has some connection to Yggdrasil, the World Tree. Some insist he was fashioned whole from a splinter of the great ash tree, while others believe he is bound to it in some fashion, much like Ratatoskr. Whatever the case, it is known that Heimdallr takes a dim view of any who might threaten Yggdrasil.\\n\\nThus, when his keen gaze settled upon the creeping tendrils of Persephone’s minions, drawing ever closer to the World Tree, Heimdallr moved instantly to confront them. Powerful as she was, even the Queen of the Underworld could not hide her intentions from the watchman of Asgard… ",

She is both sides of two extremes.\\n\\nAs the daughter of Loki, the trickster God, Hel’s destiny, much like her brothers Fenrir and Jormungandr, was doomed to darkness from the start. Odin, the All-Father, uncovered prophecies that Hel and her siblings would be the source of great calamity resulting in Ragnarök, the battle that would end all things. In an effort to prevent this, he cast each of the three into different realms; not quite a prison, though far from freedom. For Hel, Odin gave her charge of the realm of the dead, specifically those that died of sickness and old age. For himself, Odin retained Valhalla for those that died in battle.\\n\\nAt birth, Hel’s face was cast half in shadow, half in light; she was both living and dead, so took immediately and graciously to her new role, gifting Odin with the ravens Huginn and Muninn in appreciation. As the spirits of the kind-hearted, the sick, the elderly were brought to her, she cared for them, gave them comfort, yet those she deemed evil she mercilessly hurled into the frozen depths of Niflheim.\\n\\nYet, despite Odin’s efforts, destiny cannot be averted. Hel’s conflicting struggle between benevolence and malice will force her to one extreme or the other. A time will come when Hel will fulfill her prophecy, though it is yet unknown if she will be a shadow of darkness or a force of light.",

  "Lore": "Brave Hercules, a demigod son of Jupiter, born with impossible strength and force of will; for whom no task is insurmountable, no heroic deed unachievable. Yet, Like all of Jupiter’s illegitimate children, Hercules once drew the ire of Juno, and though he is now known as a hero, his greatest achievements might never have been done without Juno’s initial tragic involvement.\\n\\nShe struck Hercules mad, and he slew his own children.\\n\\nOnce recovered, grief stricken, Hercules sought penance for his crimes. An oracle of Jupiter advised he should pledge his service to the king Eurystheus, and so Hercules reluctantly did so. Jealous of the demigod, the king set him to twelve impossible tasks, expecting him to fail at the first, to slay the Nemean Lion and return with its hide.\\n\\nThe Nemean Lion captured women and devoured soldiers. Its fur was so thick no weapon could pierce it, and its claws so sharp, no armor could guard against them. Hercules tracked the lion to its mountain caves and drew it out, firing arrows that shattered against the beast’s impenetrable coat. Agilely, he dodged as the lion leapt to maul him. In the end, Hercules aimed a powerful shot straight into the lion’s roaring maw, a place the powerful fur did not protect, and slew it. Then, using the beasts own claws, he skinned the hide, wearing the mantle proudly as his new armor.\\n\\nEurystheus was aghast upon the hero’s return. Immediately the legend of Hercules began to grow. Eleven more labours the confounded king set against him, but time after time, year after year, Hercules performed what could not be done, earning fame, glory, and the peace he so desperately sought.",

Born of Osiris, and destined to ascend to the throne of the Egyptian Pantheon as its divine ruler, Horus is an entity of great power, whose formidable strength is mirrored by his innate desire for balance and justice.\\n\\nAnd yet, these grand attributes are not what has come to define Horus amongst the divine beings who walk the earth. Rather, it is strife, division and conflict that cling to him like a shadow. A shadow that has taken the form of his uncle, Set.\\n\\nSet stands in opposition to Horus’ ascension to rule, challenging so that he might be the one to take the throne and hold the destiny of their pantheon, lands and mortal worshippers in the palm of his hand. Thus has begun a path of chaos and destruction that has claimed countless lives, including that of venerable Osiris himself. Reeling from the cold-blooded murder of his father by his own uncle, Horus swore an oath to all creation, on pain of his own death, to set right the horrific deeds that had been perpetrated, and restore order, peace and justice to the land.\\n\\nFor Horus, this conflict will see his kingdom restored to its full former glory, first among equals of all the Pantheons in creation, or should he fail, see all he knows and loves cast into darkness, corruption and ruin. He has become inextricably linked with Set, a shining reflection of his uncle’s brooding darkness. Horus knows in his heart that Set will stop at nothing to achieve his aims, and so he must do the same. For the fate of all, he must prevail, no matter the cost. ",

Such incessant light and heat ravaged the earth, wilting fields of grain, drying rivers, even melting forged metal. Bent beneath the scorching rays, the people begged the Emperor-God Di Jun to aid them. In reply, he called the great archer, Hou Yi.\\n\\nArmed with a mystical red bow and a quiver of white arrows, Hou Yi traveled to Earth. What he found was a barren land. Shielding his eyes, he peered to the sky where the ten suns cruelly flared.\\n\\nNocking arrow to bow, Hou Yi loosed a warning at the suns hoping to frighten them away, but they impassively remained. So Hou Yi drew again and fired a killing shot. Pierced, the sun exploded in color and a giant red raven with three legs fell to the earth, slain by the white arrow.\\n\\nEight times more Hou Yi drew arrow to cheek. Eight shots more he let fly. Eight more bursts rent the sky, and eight more ravens fell dead. But one sun he left, and so fearful of Hou Yi's archery, this sun behaved, dipping below the horizon.\\n\\nNow armed with the power of the red ravens he smote, sending light and fire against those that threaten the world, be it monster or beast, dragon or sun, man or God, Hou Yi is the Defender of the Earth.",

  "Lore": "A grudge, like any wound, left untended will fester.\\n\\nHun Batz and his twin brother Hun Chouen, led a contented life with their grandmother. Artists and musicians, everything they created was beautiful and enchanting, but they lacked their father’s talent for the ball game, Pitz. Summoned to the underworld, their father, Hun Hunapu never returned. Instead his new offspring, half-brothers to Hun Batz and Hun Chauen, appeared. The Hero Twins were everything the original twins were not, strong, athletic, and clever. And they were extremely gifted at playing Pitz.\\n\\nA jealous rivalry formed between the two sets of twins. The more they played ball together, the more Hun Batz and his brother were defeated. Eventually, the original twins resorted to foul tricks, aggressive tactics, and out-right cheating. Frustrated with these antics, the Hero Twins kicked the ball into a tree, knowing Hun Batz and his brother considered themselves excellent climbers and would go after it. Yet, the higher they climbed, the taller the tree grew, until they could not get back down. Pleased with their magic thus far, The Hero Twins encouraged Hun Batz and Hun Chouen to use their belts like tails in order to escape the terrible height. However, upon doing so, they were mysteriously and humiliatingly transformed into monkeys.\\n\\nThough the Monkey Twins, as they are now called, came to be worshipped as Gods of Art and Music, the animosity they hold for the Hero Twins remains. Time has only sharpened their combined cunning, and they eagerly await a chance to strike back. Like any wound, their grudge has festered, and what was once a brotherly rivalry has grown into a far more deadly game.",

  "Lore": "When Isis was born, she was a Goddess. When she was married, she became a Queen. But a legendary journey to resurrect her murdered husband would make her a savior.\\n\\nFrom the God of Earth and Goddess of Sky, Isis was born, and she was a Goddess in her own right, loved by wealthy and poor alike, champion to sinners and slaves, artisans and aristocrats. She commanded the force of magic, for she knew the True Names of many things. For in the True Names lie true power.\\n\\nIsis and her husband Osiris ruled Egypt, symbols of order and justice, and led their kingdom to true prosperity. But Osiris had a brother, Set, who harbored jealousy and malice, and sought to usurp his throne. For him, murder alone was not enough. Set hacked Osiris to pieces and cast them across Egypt.\\n\\nFleeing Set’s wrath, Isis traveled the land in secret, gathering the remains of her husband. Meanwhile, Set’s rule plunged the land into chaos incarnate, and all seemed truly lost. Unable to locate a final piece, Isis could wait no longer and summoned the potent powers of her magic to reassemble her husband and give him new life. That night, their love became a child, Horus, who would avenge his father and cast evil Set out of Egypt.\\n\\nHer bravery, tenacity, her skill and love drove Isis to save Egypt and become the mother of all Pharaohs. Long has she prayed that chaos would never again rise to threaten the rule of order and prosperity, but peaceful days are at an end. This time, it may not be her husband torn asunder, but all the world, and even the Goddess of Magic may not have the power to reassemble it from oblivion.",

  "Lore": "As Izanami gave birth to the god of Fire, his searing skin scorched her flesh. Fearful she would die, her husband, Izanagi, the man with whom she had created the world, held her close and wept. But it was too late. So grievous were the wounds, Izanami succumbed to death.\\n\\nTo rescue her soul, Izanagi traveled to Yomi, the realm of darkness and death. Through the black maze he searched, until finally he came upon her, hidden amongst the shadows. He implored her to return with him. She could not, for she had already eaten the fruit that grew in Yomi. Izanagi insisted. He would not leave her in this place. He swore it.\\n\\nIzanami agreed to take her husband to see the Gods of Yomi, to implore them to free her. Meanwhile, remain in darkness, she cautioned him, for the realm of the dead was not meant for the living to see. Taken by foreboding, Izanagi lit a torch and laid eyes upon his wife. No longer the graceful, elegant beauty she once was, Izanami now appeared a rotting corpse, hollow and decayed, maggot ridden and foul. Frightened and disgusted, Izanagi broke his vow and fled.\\n\\nThrough the bowels of Yomi he ran, pursued by the fiend that was once his wife. Escaping the cave entrance, Izanagi rolled a boulder in place to block it. Sealed within, betrayed and cursed, consumed with wrathful anger, Izanami swore, one thousand lives would she take each day. One thousand to pay for the broken promise he made.\\n\\nSince then, Izanami has kept her vow, each day reaching beyond the grave to pull souls to Yomi. But war has broken the boulder that once kept her sealed away, and Izanami has emerged, cold and lifeless, but burning with a vengeance against all that lives. One thousand souls will not be enough.",

He is only the in-between, found in the changing of seasons, at the birth of a child, at the entrances to the temple and the tavern. For this reason the Romans named the first month after him: January – a portal between the old year and the new.\\n\\nYet the Roman emperors also attribute a strange tradition to Janus. At each end of his temple stand massive doors. In times of peace, these doors are closed, but in times of war, flung open. As Rome rose to power, rarely were these doors shut, but almost four hundred years of peace have clothed Rome since then and the temple has grown dusty with absence. These days, however, the doors are open once more. It seems war has returned, and the greatest of changes are upon us.",

All myths and legends contain forewarnings of a great, singular catastrophe, when the stars fall from the sky and the very earth breaks apart into nothingness. Among these days of judgement, none are eclipsed in their scale of horror and destruction foretold of more than Ragnarok, the prophesied disaster of the Norse pantheon.\\n\\nThere is a single being who acts as the herald of Ragnarok, the god known as Jormungandr, the World Serpent. A son of Loki, he is an immense, serpentine dragon, massive enough to encircle the entire world and blot the light from the sun. Dark omens are whispered of when the World Serpent will rise, casting his noxious poisons out to engulf the whole of the earth.\\n\\nThe time Jormungandr bestrides the earth is one of unmatched calamity, the days of Ragnarok where the oceans boil and the land quakes. They are days of incredible violence, where both mortal and divine blood shall soak the ground, and the World Serpent will mete out destruction with a fanatic’s zeal. He will swim through the earth and seas alike with vast snapping jaws and caustic venom, sweeping away any opponent brave enough to stand against him.\\n\\nOne such champion is Thor, the mighty God of Thunder. Long has his destiny been written that he will confront the World Serpent in the nightmarish days of Ragnarok. It is a clash that will shake creation, rivalling any battle in history, and one that neither Thor nor Jormungandr may ever walk away from.\\n\\nWoe to any who hears the trumpets of Ragnarok, for they herald the coming of Jormungandr, the instrument of their annihilation. The World Serpent exists as the bearer of the end times, the collapse of all creation. Who could hope to oppose such power?",

Yet, when the Gods themselves were defeated, Devi, the supreme Goddess, emerged to throw back this host and protect the faithful.\\n\\nThree forms she took during these ancient times. The first, Durga, the Mother of Creation, was as radiant as she was fearsome. Astride her tiger, she scattered the demon horde until she encountered the horrendous Raktabija. For each wound she gave the demon, his cursed blood created a copy, quickly resulting in an unstoppable army of Raktabija clones. Rage boiled at the corners of Durga’s mind, in the quest to slaughter and destroy evil.  From the forehead of Durga sprung her wrathful form, with skin darkened and eyes glowing a menacing red.\\n\\nThus was Kali, the Black One, Goddess of Time and Destruction, the second form of Devi born.\\n\\nRarely has Kali been seen since, kept in the shadows of Devi’s mind, but when the tides of battle shift and evil looms large, there is no solution but unrestrained destruction of evil, and Kali once again, walks the Earth.",

While the sun shines on the realm of mortal kind it is radiant Ra that guides it, but at night we share the sun with the underworld. It is not Ra that moves the sun along its subterranean path but Khepri, the scarab God, he who comes with the dawn.\\n\\nScarabs form dirt and dung into perfect spheres. Within, they lay eggs from which their young emerge fully formed. Using powerful arms and legs, scarabs can roll these spheres - many times their own size - incredible distances. It is from their father, Khepri, the sacred scarab gained this power. For the Dawn Bringer, the Sun is his sphere and all souls, living and dead, his children.\\n\\nKhepri is a guardian, a protector and a friend. He is a symbol of power and loyalty. Usually content to stay aloof, Khepri has risen for battle to defend existence from this shattering war. He will fight to shield us until the final sunset. Yet, it is he that brings the dawn.",

  "Lore": "It is often in the time of greatest strife, when a land and its people rest on the precipice of destruction, that a hero shall rise to deliver them from ruin. So it was in the ancient land of the Britons, a realm torn asunder by darkness and war, that the greatest king they would ever know would come. He was Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, King and Warden of Camelot.\\n\\nHis coming was prophesied by the great wizard Merlin, glimpsed in a comet burning though the night sky, herald of the monarch who would unite all Camelot and usher her into a new age of peace and prosperity. Though little older than a boy when King Uther fell and the mantle of ruler was passed down to him, Arthur would rise and take hold of his destiny as savior of his people. Benevolent and adept in statecraft, honourable and cunning in war, Arthur was the symbol of a new Briton.\\n\\nIn his hand is Excalibur, that mythic blade of divine power that only the most just of rulers may wield. Ever since the fateful day she first came into his possession, the sword has never left Arthur’s side, and countless are the foes he has brought low with her, the blade’s power amplified even further by his exemplary prowess in battle.\\n\\nArthur has withstood any foe who has sought Camelot’s downfall, be it the numberless hordes from beyond the seas or the sinister plots of those from within his own house. No matter the scheme, or the enemy, with the aid of his mage Merlin and his knights, Arthur has prevailed, for so long as he draws breath, Camelot’s lord shall not rest until her safety is won.\\n\\nNow, the great King hears the call of Avalon, and answers.",

Awesome and terrible to behold, majestic yet sinister, Kukulkan embodies the danger and beauty of a double-edged sword.\\n\\nTime has worn away knowledge of this God like the breeze over stone. Perhaps Kukulkan prefers this. He is known by many names and worn the face of man and beast - and worshipped with the kind of reverence born of fear.\\n\\nDotted across the vast forests of the Mayan lands stand great pyramids bearing his serpentine likeness, architecturally perfect so as to catch the light and bring to life those slithering stone statues. Painted in blood, sacrifices were made upon these sites to appease Kukulkan. He is the lord of death and rebirth.\\n\\nTo the world, he brought the four elements, but of wind he keeps control. A great gem, worn about his sinuous neck is said to be the source of all air.\\n\\nTo the people, he brought the calendar. That glorious, portentous stone disk, which counts time to a distant future, only to stop abruptly and with horrifying finality.\\n\\nTo the battlefield, he brings a legacy of power and domination. Sacrifices made for his favor were measured in blood, but mortal blood is weak. It seems that, for Kukulkan's ultimate appeasement, the blood of a God is required.",

That rumble you hear is the bellowing snore of Kumbhakarna, the Sleeping Giant.\\n\\nQuick with a laugh, honest with friends, but devastating in battle, Kumbhakarna embodies the traits of a hero, but loyalty to his tyrant brother, Ravana, often leads him to the wrong side.\\n\\nSo jovial and pious is he, that when granted a boon by Brahma, Kumbhakarna wished to take Indra's place and rule the Heavens. Indra was jealously threatened, convinced Brahma would let the good-natured giant usurp him, and magically twisted Kumbhakarna's tongue at the last second. Instead of asking for “Indraasana” (Indra's Seat), he asked for “Nidraasana,” ... to sleep.\\n\\nNow, Kumbhakarna is a dozing behemoth, waking only once every six months. Yet, Ravana is concerned with the growing fervor of the battle between gods and demons, sensing his dominion slipping. Prematurely, he has awoken his brother and pressed him to fight. Though reluctant, as if he knows his brother's stance is unjust, Kumbhakarna fights out of loyalty and a warrior's code.\\n\\nNow, that rumbling you hear, it is not his snores, but Kumbhakarna's mighty roar. Or was that a yawn?",

  "Lore": "Kappa are devious creatures. They linger just below the surface of rivers and lakes, waiting for mortals to test the water before snatching and drowning their fleshy meal. Taken merely at their appearance and juvenile sense of humor, they could be mistaken for mischievous turtle-men, almost playful in a rude sort of way, but they are dangerously strong and ruthless when submerging their prey. King among these monsters is Kuzenbo; bigger, stronger, and more cunning than the rest, but just as infantile.\\n\\nKuzenbo led his nine thousand Kappa followers to Japan, where they harried river villages and fishing boats, using their unnatural strength to pull mortals below. So clever, so hungry had the Kappa become, that Japan’s army marched to fight back, but they were no match.\\n\\nAs the bowl-shaped indentation atop a Kappa’s head is filled with water, that Kappa grows impossibly stronger - far stronger than a mortal. Yet, bound by their strange sense of honor, a Kappa must bow when bowed to, spilling their power upon the ground. It is the only known way to defeat one.\\n\\nAnd of the countless battles Kuzenbo has fought, he was defeated only twice. Upon his second defeat at the hands of General Kiyomasa, Kuzenbo was forced to swear to never again sow strife between man and beast. A vow the Kappa King has honored ever since.\\n\\nGods, however, are fair game.",

  "Lore": "Villain. It’s a word used to describe those that break the rules, that take what they want, and care nothing for those hurt along the way. Loki, the trickster God, would say villainy is nothing more than a point of view.\\n\\nThe point of view of fools too mindless to seize opportunity.\\n\\nOf course, with Loki now on the loose, the implications are dire. The end of times may be at hand. The final battle, Ragnarok, possibly on the horizon, for it was foretold that Loki would break free of his prison and herald the horrific final battle that would leave the Gods slain, the heavens sundered, and the world in ashes. None are more eager for that time of chaos than Loki.\\n\\nBefore his confinement, Loki’s malicious mischief managed to affect every God in ways both beneficial and terrible. Yet Loki’s most heinous act was in the death of the God of light, Baldr.\\n\\nBaldr’s prophetic dreams showcased his own death. Fearful for her son, Frigg forced all objects of the world to swear never to harm him. All save mistletoe. Cruelly amused, Loki forged a spear from the plant and provided it to Baldr’s brother Hodr. The Gods had a new favorite game, hurling objects at Baldr and laughing as they harmlessly ricocheted. So Hodr threw the spear, but, to everyone’s horror Baldr was impaled. Hel agreed to release Baldr from the underworld if all creatures of the world mourned the God of Light.  And all did, save one crone who refused. So Baldr died.\\n\\nWhen it was discovered the crone was Loki in disguise, the furious Gods bound him in entrails and hung a venomous serpent overhead. Loki’s wife, Sigyn, collected the dripping venom in a bowl, but when she was forced to empty it, Loki was struck, causing such anguish his thrashing would shake the world.\\n\\nBut now Loki is free and already wreaking havoc. If the prophetic Volva are correct, and they always are, then the end of all things has finally come.",

Medusa, the Gorgon.\\n\\nStories claim she was beautiful once. A priestess of Athena. Loyal and devout in action, but Poseidon was determined to make her his own. It was the fairness of her features, the golden of her hair, that attracted the Sea God. Medusa, a mortal maiden, could not refuse.\\n\\nWhen Athena learned of Medusa's betrayal, she punished the priestess.

For years she hid from the world, nursing a festering hatred for all things, craving beauty but having none, seeing none, until she became the monster she appeared to be.\\n\\nShe slithers now to the field of battle. Those wretched features concealed behind a cruel mask of porcelain perfection, eyes burning from within. All that she perceives, all that is wonderful in this world, she seeks to destroy.

Mercury can leap the space between lightning and thunder, outfox the fox king, and reach tomorrow before the sun.\\n\\nAs an infant, Mercury escaped the watchful eye of his half-brother, Apollo, stole his cattle, fashioned a lyre from a tortoise shell, and snuck in a nap, all before Apollo found him missing. His father, Jupiter, found the child’s mischief boisterously entertaining, and awarded him the task of delivering messages for the Gods, traveling between the Heavens, the Earth, and even to the depths of the Underworld.\\n\\nNow war looms and Mercury races to keep the lines of communication open, though he is often caught in the thick of battle. No stranger to combat, he once slew the monster Argus, the demon with one hundred watchful eyes, using speed and guile alone. But this war is different. The foes are stronger, the stakes higher, and Mercury a pivotal cog in the machine. Should he fail to deliver even a single order the balance could tip, and the time left for this world would be truly mercurial.",

  "Lore": "Many know the legend of King Arthur, and yet the man who set that legend into motion remains shrouded in mystery. His origins, and the source of his power, are secrets known only to him. Even his very nature is questioned. Is he simply a man greatly adept in the magical arts? A demon? Or something in between? Whatever the answer, what is beyond doubt to all who encounter him is that Arthur’s right hand, the great wizard Merlin, is a being of immense wisdom, and formidable strength.\\n\\nIn the ages of warring kings, where ruler vied against ruler and only the strongest rose to rule the land, Merlin pledged his skills in service to great sovereigns as both an advisor and a devastating battle mage. A collector of secrets and ancient lore, Merlin is a master of arcane wizardry, able to wield a myriad of elements and harness them to his will. He also devoted his mind to the art of prophesy, one day foreseeing the rise of a ruler destined to stand above all others, and unite the land beneath his banner.\\n\\nWhen Uther Pendragon fell in battle against the barbarous hordes of the invading Saxons, Merlin swore an oath of fealty to his successor, Arthur. From that day, the mage never left the wielder of legendary Excalibur’s side, a tireless advisor, fellow warrior, and friend. Together they brought about the rise of Camelot, and the unity of a once fractured land. The foul Saxons were driven back across the distant sea, and the people of the kingdom knew peace, justice and prosperity.\\n\\nTo any who think to cross Merlin, beware. Many have tested him, seeking his knowledge, his secrets, or the source of his power for themselves. And few, if any, have lived to tell their tale.",

  "Lore": "There are many stories about the girl who became a hero. Most are embellished, the events polished to a legendary sheen. They say that Hua Mulan was blessed, that her bow and blade were gifts of the gods. That she was wise beyond measure, and stronger than a hundred warriors, for her heart was pure. That she became the sworn sister of the king’s daughter. That she returned home and married a prince, or perhaps a farmer. That she died.\\n\\nBut every story, no matter how outlandish, has a grain of truth to it. And this is the truth of Hua Mulan. China was invaded and a man from every family was called to serve in the army. But her father was old and her brother a child, and so for love’s sake, she set aside her loom and went to war in their place. She disguised herself as a young man, and no one was the wiser, for her father had trained her in the ways of the bow and the blade, making her the equal of any man in the army.\\n\\nFor twelve years, she maintained the pretence. She fought well against the enemies of China, attaining rank and the loyalty of her fellow soldiers. She led men into battle more than once, setting herself where the fighting was thickest so that those who followed her might see her and take heart. At the end of that twelve years, she was offered a high rank, but turned it down. Instead, having grown tired of war, she asked only that she might return home to her family. And so she did, her duty complete.\\n\\nBut some stories do not end when the hero returns home. For some stories, that is only the beginning. For now, a new danger stirs, and Hua Mulan must once more take up her weapons in defense of her homeland...",

During this time, the Dragon Gods, led by Ao Kuang, terrorized the people, sending floods and storms, and demanding not just food, but child sacrifices to feast upon as well.\\n\\nInto this world was Nezha born, a full grown boy with laughter in his eyes, trained by the immortal sage Taiyi Zhenren, who gave him the powerful Universe Ring and Armillary Sash. Youthful and carefree, Nezha was also headstrong, often arguing with his father what was right and wrong.\\n\\nBut youth does not last forever, and Nezha’s life changed defending two friends against a captain of Ao Kuang’s army. Insulted, the Dragon God commanded his third son, Ao Bing, to defeat the boy, but in the end, Nehza slew his opponent. Furious with grief, Ao Kuang demanded Nezha’s father make reparations for the offense committed by his son, or he would send floods and storms to ravage the land. Nezha, humbly, sacrificed himself to appease the Dragon God, but evil Ao Kuang sent storms anyway.\\n\\nTaiyi Zhenren worked his wisdom, and from the petals of a Lotus plant, Nezha was reborn. The immortal sage gave him new weapons – the Fire Tipped Spear and Wind Fire Wheels – weapons to challenge even the Dragon God and defeat him once and for all.\\n\\nTime has passed since Ao Kuang’s ruin, but the winds of war are rising and new Gods of Tyranny challenge the safety of the defenseless. Once again, Nezha will set aside his youth and stand against the tide, for not even death can stop him.",

Yet, from water comes all life, and from this primordial force was born the first of Goddesses, Neith.\\n\\nAs the waters continued to form the world and everything within it, Neith’s natural instinct to protect and nurture the people led her to champion the hunt. With meat she fed them and with hides she clothed them, but as the people she sought to protect grew old, or sick, or died on the battlefield, Neith’s compassion forced her to change her calling.\\n\\nWith nimble fingers, the Goddess wove shrouds to shield the lost spirits of the dead on their journey to the underworld, leaving a loose thread she could trace as the ghosts ventured down the river. As time passed, more and more threads spread across the world, weaving an intricate pattern of fate that only Neith could see.\\n\\nNow, the war between Gods grows ever more fevered, and Neith can no longer sit idle. The threads of fate are fraying at the edges and she must once again pick up her bow and hunt, or watch the world return to the waters from whence it came.",

But when punishment is due, there is one from whom even the God of Thunder shrinks. She is Nemesis, the red-washed blade of Divine Retribution.\\n\\nRecall the tale of Narcissus, so taken by his own beauty. Proudly, his visage was flaunted, to the detriment of all. Until, at last, he was led to a pond of crystal hue where his own reflection enraptured him. So long did he remain to gaze upon this self-image that hunger claimed his life. Thus does Nemesis respond to hubris. It is consequence equal to the crime.\\n\\nNow, behold the war torn land, beset by the wrath of wanton Gods filling the air with blood and boasts. This battlefield is stained with hubris. Unwittingly, these foolish warriors have summoned their greatest adversary. Nemesis has come!\\n\\nNo longer will foul deeds engender success, no hoard of wealth held in undeserving hands, no legends told when falsely earned. Nemesis will unleash a tide of retribution. Punishment for the crime of hubris is death.",

If that is true, then history is shaped by a single Goddess: Nike, the winged warrior.\\n\\nWhen the fastest runner bears a golden medal, when a cunning hunter slays the fiercest beast, when the soldiers seize the day, the Faithful of Olympus praise Nike. Without her favor, failure is ensured, and obscurity certain.\\n\\nEven mighty Zeus, a king among Gods, seeks the favor of Nike. On the smoke strewn fields of antiquity, when the God of Thunder marched against his Titan forebears, Nike fought by his side, her dauntless blade inspiring confidence in her allies as they faced an impossible foe. Without her, all the heavens are left to wonder if Zeus would have carried that day. Had Zeus fallen, the world as it is known would have fallen with him.\\n\\nSo, all hail the victor! She has finally taken the field. As Gods and Gorgons clash and battles most fierce and foul are fought, she alone shapes the day. For history is written by the victor, and Nike is victory incarnate.",

Nox is mother to them all. So too is she the mother of misfortune: Doom and Blame, Deceit, Strife, Woe and Death. Nox must love and protect all her children equally, as any mother would. They are her calling and her curse; her greatest pride and deepest shame. It is for her children she has now come to war.\\n\\nClothed not in black, but blackness, Nox is rarely seen. She glides between the light, just at the edge of vision. A specter. Even the God of Thunder is known to fear her, for Nox could steal his whispered breath and send him to a sleep eternal where dreams do not exist and no one ever wakes with the dawn.",

Firestorms, floods, and bloodthirsty monsters ravaged the land and stole the lives of more than can be counted. In ages past, Nu Wa, Guardian of Heaven and Earth, hand-crafted all people from clay. They were her creations, her children, her responsibility.\\n\\nAs the Earth shuddered and broke, and the skies turned black with ash, Nu Wa forged five mystic stones, one for each of the elemental forces of nature: Earth, Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. With the power of these stones, she slew a gargantuan tortoise, severed its legs, and raced to the broken World Pillar. One leg she used to prop the Heavens aloft and with the elemental stones, she sealed it in place. Balance between Heaven and Earth was restored, but the world was never the same. Skies cleared, but the stars had shifted. Seas retreated, but rivers drained westward. Everything leaned, but the End was averted.\\n\\nIn the years that followed, Nu Wa and her brother, Fu Xi, took the throne of China. They ruled with wisdom and ushered in an age of recovery and prosperity, for which she is adored and worshipped to this day.\\n\\nYet, the skies grow dark once more and chaos threatens to engulf the land. Gods from all Pantheons have chosen Earth as a battleground, trading blows with the same thoughtless fervor that destroyed the World Pillar so long ago. Determined to prevent such calamity from repeating, Nu Wa has summoned the elemental stones once more. For she is the Guardian of Heaven and Earth; all mankind are her creations, her children, her responsibility.",

Atop Asgard, where Odin presides, he is known as the bringer of war, a sage of wisdom, and the keeper of souls slain in battle.\\n\\nAs a warrior, Odin rides his eight legged steed, Sleipnir, and wields the mighty spear Gungnir. Accompanying him are two wolves and his two trusted ravens, Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory), who fly around Midgard and return to Odin with all they see and hear.\\n\\nAs a sage, Odin travels disguised as a simple wanderer, seeking wisdom. His thirst for knowledge has come at great personal cost, having been hanged from the branches of Yggdrasil, the world tree, for nine days and nights and sacrificed one of his eyes to the Well of Wisdom.\\n\\nAs keeper of souls, Odin welcomes slain warriors to his mighty hall of Valhalla on the agreement they will aid him at Ragnarok. Favored female warriors become his elite Valkyrie that usher those worthy of entry to Valhalla.\\n\\nIt is in preparation for the final days of Ragnarok he does all this. For the seers claim his death will come at the fangs of the great wolf Fenrir, and like anyone, Odin seeks to change his fate. Yet, never once have the volva been mistaken.",

Greatest of their number is Olorun, God of the Sky and the Heavens, and supreme deity of the Yoruba pantheon. It was Olorun who kindled the spark that would become the sun, and at his command, the Orishas – the Yoruba gods – crafted the world and its inhabitants from the gathered dust of the cosmos.\\n\\nBut though Olorun is the greatest of the Orishas, he seeks no worshippers and asks for no offerings, yet entire nations follow his ideals. Like the stars, he is a remote deity, content to sit in quiet contemplation of the myriad wonders of creation. And he is powerful enough to ensure the sanctity of his solitude. Olorun commands the fundamental forces of the cosmos – even time itself.\\n\\nYet despite this power, Olorun is but one part of a greater whole. A tripartite being, Olorun possesses two other aspects – Olodumare, creator of the universe, and Olofi, the conduit between Earth and the Heavens. As befits a being of such might, Olorun is wise beyond measure, and rarely acts rashly or without some greater purpose in mind. Peaceful by nature, he will nonetheless fight when the need is great.\\n\\nIt is for that very reason that Olorun has chosen to break his long seclusion at last. Despite having held himself apart from the world, he has borne witness to the suffering of mortal and immortal alike. With his far-reaching gaze, he has seen that the thrones of the great pantheons are empty, and that god wars against god.\\n\\nIn his great wisdom, Olorun has realised that only a king can unite them.\\n\\nAnd he will be that king.

Would that he had been left to shape the world, but the jealousy of his brother, Set, changed the course of fate.\\n\\nSeeking to usurp the throne, Set deceived and murdered his brother, tearing his body to pieces and casting them across the land. Isis, Osiris’ wife, secretly fled while Set plunged the kingdom into darkness. For years she toiled to reassemble her husband while his spirit form, his Ba, endured. Yet for all her searching, she could not find every part of him, and Isis was forced to reanimate Osiris without. Though not strong enough to defy Set in this incomplete form, Osiris gave Isis a son that would topple the tyrant Set and restore balance to Egypt.\\n\\nWhat remains of Osiris is a fragment of what he once was. Robbed of his crown over the earth, he now governs the realm of the dead with the same benevolence he ruled the living. But darkness looms again, and though broken, Osiris refuses to sit idly by. Mustering the last of his strength and spirit, Osiris seeks to change the course of fate, this time for the light over darkness.",

  "Lore": "Pele is the goddess of Fire, of Dance and Wind, of Volcanoes and Violence. Those who worship Pele speak of her as Madame Pele or Tutu Pele, while others know her as Ka wahine ‘ai honua, ‘the woman who devours the land’. Though she is capable of great acts of destruction, and possesses the temper to provoke such acts, Pele is both destroyer and creator. It was through her mastery over the world’s molten core that she wrought the Hawaiian Islands into being, forging them from the lava that ruptured forth from the mouths of her volcanoes. They are places of immense beauty, lush and brimming with life, and by looking upon and revelling in such beauty, you offer Pele worship.\\n\\nBorn of Kane Milohai, who wrought the earth, sky and heavens, and the Earth goddess Haumea, Pele is one of fourteen children, seven sisters and seven brothers. It is from the enmity between these siblings that Pele arrived in Hawaii, after her exile at the hands of Kane Milohai for her fiery temper and conflict with her sister Namakaokahai, goddess of the Sea. Pursued across the oceans by Namakaikahai, Pele wrought Hawaii into a paradise, making her home within the great calderas of the volcanoes that stand sentinel across the island chain.\\n\\nTo worship Pele is to grant one’s devotion to a goddess of terrible power, one who can shape and render a grand, vibrant world into being at her slightest whim, and burn it to ashes just as quickly. But just as her worshippers are devoted to Pele, she devotes herself to them as a force of divine protection and care. She is a tireless defender of life and the people that dwell upon her islands, and any that seek to threaten them shall surely taste Pele’s fire.",

Demeter enrolled her in helping with her Mysteries while Zeus took it upon himself to give her away. Hades, her husband to be, came up from the underworld and took her away. Demeter, saddened by the loss of her daughter and helper, wept and refused to continue bringing life to the earth. Cornered by a dying world, Zeus forced Hades and Persephone to part.\\n\\nBefore leaving the underworld Hades offered her a seed of a Pomegranate grown in the underworld. Persephone was clever. She understood what was being offered. Those who eat the food of the underworld are bound to it and must return. Hades was offering her a choice. A choice she was happy to accept. Every six months Persephone leaves the underworld, soothing Demeter’s grief and bringing life back to the world.\\n\\nThe time has now come for Persephone, Queen of the Underworld, to return and take her throne besides Hades. She has seen the gods struggle against themselves at the expense of those around them. She can no longer watch as droves of mortal souls arrive; their lives cut short while they struggled for each and every victory as the gods they pray to cause their suffering. Soon all gods will see why she is called ‘Clever Persephone’.",

  "Lore": "Deep beneath the turbulent tides of the ocean lingers a God of idle rage. What must it be like to live forever in the shadow of your brother? To be denied again and again that which you desire, despite the power of the wrathful seas at your command? So Poseidon broods on his throne at the ocean floor.\\n\\nAs a child, Poseidon and his brother, Hades, were consumed by their father, Cronus. Powerless to escape, it was left to mighty Zeus to free them and slay their patron. Together, they defeated the last of the Titans and ushered in a new age of dominance for Olympian Gods, but their freedom, their very lives, Zeus would never let either brother forget were owed to him. Even as the heavens, the underworld, and the seas were divided among them, Zeus positioned himself as king of all, and what was Poseidon to do but be thankful he had been spared a fate in his father’s belly? So he retired to his new realm and began the pursuit of gathering worshippers.\\n\\nSoon rose a great ocean front city of mankind, and Poseidon presented himself as their God, but another had already come, Athena, Zeus’ daughter. A competition was held – each God would offer a gift and the people would select their sponsor. Confident, Poseidon drove his Trident, a trophy from the battle against the Titans, into the ground and a limitless spring emerged, but the people found the water salty and undrinkable. Athena extended her hand and a graceful olive tree rose from the earth. Wood, food, and oil, all from one gift. The people decided and the city was called Athens.\\n\\nIt may be that Poseidon never desired greatness as Zeus did. Had his father never consumed him, had he never been made God of the Sea, had his brother never crowned himself King of the Gods, Poseidon might have lived contentedly, but that chance is gone. Now, with the very tides at his command, an army of sea beasts at his back, and the formidable Kraken at his call, the glowering God of the deep seeks to quench his thirsty rage and plunge all the world in endless, wrathful seas.",

  "Lore": "Without the sun, there would be no light, no warmth, no life. Without Ra, there would be no sun.\\n\\nRa is a guardian, the keeper of Ma’at - order and truth, and master of the sun. Each day he sails across the sky in a golden ship, and each night traverses the underworld, bringing light and warmth to the dead beneath the horizon. For those in the scorched South, Ra was the first God, creator of earth and sky and father to all other Gods.\\n\\nBut Ra’s time is fading like a twilight sky. His descendants have grown in power and prominence and seek to replace him as the figure of authority. His own granddaughter, Isis, cleverly poisoned him by secretly summoning a viper under his feet. When he stepped on it, the serpent’s venomous bite poisoned him. Isis promised to heal Ra if he revealed to her his True Name. At first, he refused, for knowledge of his True Name would give Isis unparalleled power over him, but as the pain mounted, Ra was forced to relent. Isis kept her word and Ra was healed, though the cost may have been too high.\\n\\nLight can heal, but light can also burn, and the great protector is showing signs of wrath not seen since mankind’s insolence. In that rare moment of anger, Ra sent his daughter, Hathor, in the form of a lion, to devour the people. However, he ended her bloody feeding before she consumed all mankind. This time, his burning gaze is set on the other Gods. When his wrath finally cools, nothing may be left but ash.",

Let this speak, then, of its master, the demon faced God, Raijin, who summons this force with the pounding of his great drums.\\n\\nEver in conflict with his equally fearsome brother, Fujin, Master of Wind, Raijin vies for control of the skies above the Realm of the Rising Sun. For mortals, their battles form dramatic storms and devastating tidal waves, but for the brothers, this is just friendly competition; an ongoing tournament to determine the strongest.\\n\\nThough monstrous in appearance and intimidating in battle, Raijin is generous to his Faithful, clearing the detritus with lightning to leave rice fields all the more fertile. That doesn’t stop parents from warning their children to hide when a storm comes, lest Raijin devour their bellies. Raijin no doubt finds this tale amusing but has yet to actually feast on any toddlers.\\n\\nWar has reached the distant shores of Raijin’s island realm, and for the first time, he has encountered other Gods that claim dominion over lightning, thunder, and the sky itself. Relishing this opportunity to prove dominance, Raijin enters the fray, drums pounding, and his boisterous laugh indistinguishable from rolling thunder.",

  "Lore": "Ravana's immortal reign subjugates the people. Shiva's boon grants the demon-king invulnerability against gods and beasts. Only mortal men stand a chance of defeating him, but Ravana's might is too potent for a mere man to overcome. All seems lost.\\n\\nTo save us, Vishnu took human form. Rama, prince of Ayodhya.\\n\\nAt age 16 he was already the perfect embodiment of man. Strong, humble, handsome, patient, devout; he is what mankind strives to be, yet, for all our flaws, can never reach.\\n\\nWhen a neighboring kingdom, cursed by Ravana's magic, asked for aid, Rama answered, despite the misgivings of his father. With his brother Laksharma, Rama set out and slew a horde of demons. At the palace, Rama cleansed the curse by freeing the queen from stone. The city celebrated and Rama was invited to string Shiva's bow – with the prize princess Sita's hand in marriage. Shiva's bow could not be lifted by any man, let alone strung, but Rama broke the bow in half. He and Sita wed immediately.\\n\\nReturning home, Rama was to be crown prince, but the jealousy of queen Kaikeyi forced Rama into exile, where he's remained these past fourteen years.\\n\\nYet Rama was recently seen on the field of battle. Word is, Ravana stole Rama's wife, and Rama left exile to embrace his destiny. He must defeat Ravana, free his wife, and set mankind on a path for peace, else darkness and evil will conquer all.",

For years he worshipped, showing his devotion through isolation, prayer, and penance before the shrine of Shiva. Yet for years he was met with only silence. In his pursuit of immortality, he sacrificed his very life. He cut off his own head.\\n\\nAgony and pain met him as it regrew. He was greeted not by Death, but by rejection. Shiva the destroyer did not want him. Ravana was undaunted. Nine more times his head was offered, and on his tenth sacrifice, finally Shiva was sated.\\n\\nFor the Demon King, Shiva granted a boon. Instead of immortality, he gained invulnerability against those he viewed as threats: Gods and Demons. Ravana could not be destroyed.\\n\\nA master of combat, a genius scholar, a peerless leader, and now invincible, Ravana amassed an army of fiends and monsters to conquer the world. None could stop him. The Monkey King tried, but Ravana fought off his attacks. The Demon King’s armies conquered all, leaving Ravana to rule from a golden throne.\\n\\nVishnu, in his wisdom and grace, would not permit Ravana’s dominance. By Gods and Demons Ravana could not be harmed, but by mortals...\\n\\nThus was Vishnu reborn Rama, a mere man. Now trained as a warrior, Rama calls the Demon King to battle.\\n\\nPride scraping like a knee on stone, Ravana rallies his monstrous siblings, his conquered allies, and his formidable army to answer Rama’s taunt. And their rivalry will shake the world.",

No ship that dares sail in her waters goes unscathed. Those that cling to survival whisper panicked tales of enormous black tentacles tipped with slavering hound heads ravaging whole ships to splinters with pitiless precision. Though it’s her laughter, they say, that’s most horrible; child-like, delighting in blood soaked murder as men are dragged into the dark abyss.\\n\\nPoets have tried to romanticize this beast, to provide some humanity to her monstrosity. They write she was once a beautiful Naiad, wronged by a jealous priestess and transformed. Yet the old poems say she was born this way, beget by gods full of jealousy and loathing; dropped into the sea to terrorize mankind.\\n\\nWould that she had remained in the sea, but the nightmare has come ashore. Dragged by dog-headed tentacles she roams our streets, plucks us from our beds, and fills the night with disturbing laughter. Scylla has come, and not even the gods can help us.",

Yet, for all the dread they induce, they never strike randomly or in anger. Poison of any kind is controlled and administered only to those deserving of such punishment. Serqet, Goddess of Venom sees to this.\\n\\nThough crushing strangulation and pain await those touched by her sting, Serqet is not a deity of retribution but guardianship. The wakeless dead are embalmed and preserved for all time in fluids taken from Serqet's beasts. Of the four sacred Canopic Jars which hold the internal organs of the mummified, Serqet is the watcher of one. And, though her strikes mean certain death, Serqet can cleanse poison as easily as apply it.\\n\\nA battlefield is a strange place to find this Goddess. Normally, Serqet is an invisible presence. She watches. She waits. She learns before she strikes and ensures that those she kills deserve such an end. It must be that the vanity of the Gods has pushed Serqet too far. Now all will meet death with venom in their veins.",

He looked to that son, fair Horus, starved of the means to take the reigns of command when his appointed time came, incapable of leading them into any future but darkness. Set looked upon an unworthy king, and a worse successor, and he chose to act.\\n\\nHe knew the world would seek to damn him, to decry his deeds as those of a murderer, slavering for power. But Set would endure such lies, to save his kingdom. He would seize the throne back from the unworthy and the weak, from the sinister and the corrupt, and in time, when the truth of the world mirrored the truth he desired in his heart, they would throng the streets to praise him.

  "Lore": "Full of mirth rang the halls of Asgard. Celebrating, the Gods drank of mead and feasted on roasted beast while the corpse of their defeated foe, the Jotun Thjazi, lay cold nearby. For decades were they at odds. Now, that conflict was ended. Odin and his ilk openly boasted of their achievements, laughing and cheering while the floor ran wet with spilled spirits. \\n\\nThen, the doors swung wide, breathing icy winter wind across the hall. There she stood, spear in hand, skin, porcelain pale, clad in snow dusted furs, and eyes blue as glacier ice but smoldering with vengeful fire. Skadi, the Jotun’s daughter had come. \\n\\nTransfixed by her beauty, the gathered Gods sought to dissuade her from violence. As a symbol of honor, Odin cast the eyes of her father into the heavens to twinkle as stars for eternity. Skadi was not moved. A life for a life, she demanded. \\n\\nIt was Loki that softened her heart with humor and dance. So jovial was he that, at last, her frozen features cracked a smile. \\n\\nA wedding! Odin declared. Skadi would marry a God and so, herself become a Goddess. This would be her payment for the life of her father. Now warmed to them, Skadi agreed. Blindfolded, she was to choose her husband by only his feet. Eligible men came forth and Skadi made her choice. \\n\\nTheir marriage did not last. Niord was a God of Summer and Skadi a Goddess of Winter. After a few years, they amicably parted ways. Skadi returned to the snow-capped mountains of her youth, but without her father or husband, she soon grew lonely. Word spread of a war between the Pantheons. Odin and Loki, Niord and Ullr; these Gods were her family now, and Skadi would not lose the only family she had left.",

His children were everything a father could dream, but Odin and his ilk were not pleased. For a father's hubris, Mani and Sol were punished.\\n\\nTo the sky, they were sent, each to lead the chariot that dragged the sun or the moon. At their heels were loosed the bloodthirsty sons of Fenrir. Hungry wolves, relentless in pursuit of their prey.\\n\\nResigned, Mani guided his steeds through the night, ever ahead of his hunter, but Sol did not accept her fate. Furious at the Gods, she taunts and challenges the wolf Skoll as she blazes across the sky, unleashing her spite on the only opponent she can reach.\\n\\nOdin has never shown signs of regret for his decision, but now war is upon the land. His attentions are turned. Sol, normally confined to her chariot has found a way to send her flaming essence to the battlefield. To the casual observer, the combat, the bloodshed, may all seem just a game to Sol, but she is driven by an age old grudge and a desire to be free.",

He defied death itself by wiping his name from the Book of Life and Death, and united many of the other monster tribes who sought to ally with him, an act that garnered the attention of the Jade Emperor.\\n\\nIn an effort to better control the Monkey-King, the Jade Emperor awarded him a title, but when Sun Wukong discovered his new position was little more than “stable boy” he grew angry and declared himself “Great Sage, Equal of Heaven,” and waged war on the heavens. For this treasonous act, he was finally captured and imprisoned beneath a mountain for five centuries.\\n\\nAt long last, the humble monk Xuanzang was seeking disciples to protect him while on his legendary Journey to the West to collect the Indian Sutras. Sun Wukong gladly agreed to serve him, but the Buddha wrapped a golden circlet around the Monkey King’s head so that Xuanzang could control him. With three other disciples, they faced eighty one trials during their quest, and collected the sutras. For his service and strength, Sun Wukong was awarded Buddhahood, finally ascending to heaven and gaining immortality.\\n\\nWith an epic battle between Gods taking place, Sun Wukong’s presence is all but assured.",

  "Lore": "Like his sister, Amaterasu, Susano was born to rule, but he was tempestuous, with a flaring anger, wicked tongue, and a penchant for destruction. Their father, Izanagi, would have none of it and decreed that Susano live in the Underworld. His mood dark at this news, Susano committed heinous acts of vandalism and murder. Acts that sent Amaterasu into shameful hiding.\\n\\nCast low, Susano descended to earth on his way to the Underworld. He carried only his Ten-Span Sword, and regret for his actions. What had his defilements achieved but to envelop the world in darkness? This was his nature, to broil like a storm, to frighten and destroy what stood in his path.\\n\\nBut a storm could also herald life.\\n\\nAt a river side, Susano ventured upon an elderly couple, weeping and cradling their young daughter. Eight children, they’d had once, but now only one remained; seven devoured by the eight-headed serpent. Susano was resolved. To atone for his crimes, to prove his father wrong, to better himself, Susano would slay this beast.\\n\\nEight traps he laid, one for each head of the creature, with eight tubs of aromatic saké as bait. Slithering forward, the Orochi spread its gruesome heads to drink from the trapped tubs. Susano cut the rope. Gates dropped. The heads were imprisoned. One by one, he chopped the eight necks, until only the wriggling tail remained. Sweeping his blade split the reptilian hide, leaving notches in his blade but revealing a brilliant sword inside: the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.\\n\\nTo his sister, he gave the blade. An act of atonement, but not an apology. His true nature would never change, but his intention could.\\n\\nThough seen on the battlefield of the Gods, Susano’s fight is not truly against those foes, but within himself. He is a raging summer storm, struggling to focus that destructive power at evil, and atoning when the innocent are harmed.",

He protects and nurtures those that respect his domain.\\n\\nWhen the boy Cyparissus went traveling with his pet deer, Sylvanus accidently allowed wolves to hunt the peaceful animal. So stricken with grief at the loss of his pet, the child succumbed to despair and died. Wracked with guilt, Sylvanus transformed the child into the Cypress tree, whose sap weeps like the saddened child.\\n\\nOld and wise, Sylvanus views the passing of time with ease and understanding. His laughter is the wind in the leaves, his touch the sprout of flowers from the earth, and his voice the call to calm the most savage beast. He is slow to anger and slower to act, which is why his presence on the battlefield is so strange. As the war between Gods spills into the idyllic realms Sylvanus keeps, he is left with no choice but fight back.",

Long has she slept; since her son, the Titan Saturn, was cast down by his own son. It had all gone so wrong.\\n\\nAt the forging of creation, Terra was split from all other primordial matter to form the earth. Above her, Uranus, the sky, suspended angelically. She loved him immediately and made him her king. Their children were Titans, beings even more powerful than they. In his fear and jealousy, Uranus buried the Titans within the earth. Terra began to see the arrogance, the vanity, the hatred in her husband. Conspiring with her children, she freed them and overthrew Uranus.\\n\\nYoungest of the Titans, Saturn, ruled next. Terra could not have been more proud, but prophecies claimed Saturn would be defeated by his children, just as Uranus had. To prevent this, Saturn consumed his offspring. All but one. Jupiter escaped, and with righteous fury split Saturn open, unleashing his swallowed siblings. Violently, they defeated the Titans, Terra’s children, and claimed the world as their own.\\n\\nMournful of the children she lost, Terra slept. And ages passed.\\n\\nBut the ravages of a new war have scarred her skin. Her grandchildren, those arrogant, vain, treacherous Gods that stole the world from her son, those Gods, so reminiscent of Uranus, bleed into her bones with every battle. Now, she finally rises from her slumber. She rises to claim the throne for herself.",

They are reaped by the nightmarish God of Death, whose grim visage strikes strange against the gleeful satisfaction he feels at performing his work. Thanatos is the very face of death.\\n\\nYet, to Thanatos, Mortals are easy prey. Their end is preordained, harvesting them but a game to pass the eons, but a God, a being beyond the mortal coil, now there is a creature Thanatos eyes with greedy longing. He despises the immortality other Gods covet. To him, it is a perversion and defiance of his very purpose.\\n\\nBut can a God truly die? As the Heavens clash and immortal blood spills on the Earth, Thanatos hungers to find out. War is but the preamble to death, a battlefield of souls rent from their bodies, listlessly waiting to be taken by the God of Death. A war between Gods, a war of this magnitude can mean only one thing. Thanatos is about to be very, very busy.",

In truth, she is many Goddesses, with many names and many forms. But there is only one title. The Morrigan\\n\\nAnu, Macha, Badb. Individually, these three Goddesses were sisters, progenitors of sovereignty, war, and death. They were caretakers of their lush green Éire, champions for armored soldiers, guides for the deceased. It is unknown what bound them together. Some whispered curse, some lover’s scorn. Some dark power or darker purposes.  But now they are one.\\n\\nShe’s been seen in many shapes. The lurid seductress, the wrinkled hag, the screaming crow, and worst of all, the washer in the river. For those who witness her cleaning their bloody armor prophesies a violent end.\\n\\nSubtle and manipulative, there is no war The Morrigan did not incite. No dying breath she did not collect. Even this war, a war between Gods, must secretly be of her making. So, beware those that behold her, for The Morrigan controls your fate.",

  "Lore": "Thor, as famous as he is bold, is God of the thundering sky. Yet his hammer, Mjolnir is nearly as famous as he is, and Thor will not be parted from it.\\n\\nOdin, the All-Father, bore many children, but none as well known nor as mighty as Thor, who had the strength to move mountains and the power to call lightning from the sky. Despite these incredible gifts, Thor’s enemies were cunning, bloodthirsty, and numerous. The Frost Giants constantly threatened to invade Asgard requiring every ounce of Thor’s near limitless strength just to keep them at bay. Had the tide truly turned, Asgard might have been destroyed, but a simple prank played by the treacherous Loki ended with the creation of Mjolnir, the legendary hammer, and with it, Thor utterly crushed the Frost Giants.\\n\\nSif, Thor’s wife, had hair like rays of sun through a cloudy sky, and Loki, being covetous, secretly sheared it off while she slept. Mad with fury, Thor demanded Loki fix this. So, Loki went to the dwarves of Ivaldi who forged a golden crown that would grow equally golden hair, a spear that never missed its mark, and a ship that would never sink. Proud of his treasures, Loki returned to Thor and the other Gods, gave the crown to Sif, then bragged that no greater items could be forged.\\n\\nThe dwarf Brokk took offense to this and claimed that he and his brother could do better. Loki bet his head they could not. So, Brokk and his brother forged three items, a ring that made a duplicate every nine days, a golden pig that could fly and swim, and the hammer, Mjolnir, with the power to shatter mountains. As each item was forged, Brokk was bitten fiercely by a fly, yet only on the third did he flinch, causing the short handle on the hammer. When they were done, the dwarves took their artifacts before the Gods and decried Loki’s fly disguise. All the Gods agreed that Brokk and his brother had forged greater items. Loki, ever cunning, declared his neck was not part of the bargain, denying them his head.\\n\\nMjolnir went to Thor to battle the Frost Giants. Proud and mighty, Thor beat back the evil horde and continues to defend Asgard to this day. With Mjolnir in hand, Thor is an unstoppable force that even other Gods would do well to avoid.",

Wielding his twin tonfa, Shingetsu and Mangetsu, he overcomes his enemies with effortless skill and a mocking laugh, forcing them to bow before him – for what good is victory without an audience to see it?\\n\\nHe is the opposite in every way of his sibling, Amaterasu. Where she is light, he is dark. Where she is kind, he is cruel. But in his cruelty there is purpose. A true leader cannot show weakness, cannot brook insult – even one unintentionally given.\\n\\nSuch was the reason that Tsukuyomi struck off the head of the goddess of plenty, Uke Mochi. For her manner offended him, and offense must be answered as swiftly and surely as possible, lest weakness be revealed. Order must be maintained, whatever the cost.\\n\\nAmaterasu did not understand. She cast Tsukuyomi from her sight, forever exiling him from the heavens. The day would be hers, and the night his.

On the third attempt, Fenrir sensed a trick and demanded one of the Gods place their hand into his mouth. If the binding proved magical, Fenrir would take the hand. Tyr agreed.\\n\\nJustice is not adherence to the law, but a code of fairness and morality.\\n\\nBound by the mystical ribbon, Fenrir devoured Tyr’s hand. It was the price to be paid. And Tyr paid it willingly. Even Fenrir deserved justice.\\n\\nOne handed, Tyr is worshipped as a pinnacle of righteousness, called upon for valor in battle, balance in law, and the fortitude to face the impossible.

Reserved, secretive, Ullr does not represent the tankard downing, boast bellowing contemporaries of the Norse Pantheon, but pays respectful tribute to glory in all its forms.\\n\\nGlory is in the silence of snowfall, in the honorable victory earned from single combat, in the perfect curve of a yew bow firing an arrow true. Dotted across the lands of the Faithful, shrines to Ullr can be found in remote, secluded hideaways. It is there that glory is found in the sanctity of a vow, once sworn, never broken, and bound by a ring, no matter how crude, then buried in the earth to weather the ages of time.\\n\\nThough rarely spoken of, he is highly regarded, even among the Gods, for it is Ullr, not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the All Father is away. Other Gods might use the opportunity to abuse the power, but Ullr’s rule is merely an extension thereof. So much so that only the innermost circle even know that Odin is gone.\\n\\nAll the more noticeable is it, then, that Ullr has abandoned this post to join the fray. Early on did Odin take the field of battle, leaving Ullr to manage the kingdom. So great a threat must this war be as to endanger the very survival of Asgard. Whatever the reason, Ullr comes to preserve glory, which, for him, may be the whole world.",

  "Lore": "Though small of stature, Vamana, the Fifth Avatar of Vishnu, should never be underestimated. His harsh lessons in humility have shamed even the proudest of kings.\\n\\nThe demon king, Bali, was fair and righteous, yet for all his virtues, Bali was extremely proud and driven by fierce ambition. After conquering the Underworld and all the Earth, Bali managed to wrest the Heavens from the God Indra. Unable to reclaim his seat, Indra implored Vishnu for aid, and so Vishnu took the form of a small mortal man, a priest named Vamana.\\n\\nIn his splendid palace, Bali was giving gifts to the pious. Vishnu, disguised as the monk Vamana and carrying a wooden umbrella, requested only as much land as he could cover in three steps. Bali offered Vamana an island but Vamana stuck to his request, which Bali granted against the wishes of his advisor. Immediately, Vamana grew to cosmic proportions, crashing through the ceiling of the palace and filling the sky. With one colossal step, he engulfed all the Earth and the Underworld. With a second step, he consumed the heavens. Now, with everything under his two units, Vamana had nowhere to place his third step. He challenged Bali to go back on his word or offer somewhere else for him to step. Bali’s demon army surged forth, but the demon king held them back. Bowing in humility, Bali offered his head as the third step. Vamana sends Bali to the underworld but, in recognizing Bali’s benevolence, shows mercy by granting him sovereignty over it in appreciation of Bali’s sacrifice.\\n\\nVishnu returned control of the Heavens to Indra and left his Avatar behind, but he also left behind a valuable lesson. Even the mightiest and most arrogant of kings can be humbled by the smallest of men.",

When the very earth rumbles and mountains erupt in searing flame, it is Vulcan’s rage that burns. Smith of the Gods, Vulcan crafts with fire and forge as an artist would with paint and brush.\\n\\nAs an infant, so hideous was Vulcan that his disgusted mother, Juno, cast him into the sea from the heights of Mount Olympus. So great was the fall, it smashed one of Vulcan’s legs, a wound from which he would never recover.  Beneath the waves, a sea nymph, Thetis, rescued the child-god and raised him as her own. As Vulcan grew, he ventured to the surface and discovered fire and the art of smithing. His natural talents emerged and he forged wondrous jewels for his adopted mother.\\n\\nSummoned to a gala on Mount Olympus, Thetis wore Vulcan’s glittering gifts, but when Juno discovered Vulcan had made them, she jealously demanded he return to Mount Olympus. Angrily, Vulcan refused. In his stead, he sent a magnificent throne of gold and gems that imprisoned Juno when she sat upon it.\\n\\nFor three days Juno was so entombed, and would have remained so had not Jupiter, Vulcan’s father, interjected. To Vulcan he offered an exchange, Juno’s freedom for the hand of Venus, the most beautiful Goddess of Love. Vulcan agreed.\\n\\nThough his vengeance was served cold, the fire of spite still burns in Vulcan’s chest. Unable to truly forgive, he loses himself at the forge. None of the wondrous chariots, jewelry or weapons he crafts can ever fill the hurt in his heart, but each one is worthy of a God.",

Ferociously he came at them, but only snatched Hunahpu and tore off the boy’s arm. Cleverly, the twins enlisted the aid of an elderly couple and advised them to pose as dentists. Seven Macaw sought to ease the pain in his mouth, so, as they were instructed, the dentists pulled the rest of Seven Macaw’s teeth and replaced them with white corn. So humiliated was the great bird that he died of despair.\\n\\nIt would be many years and several trials later that, at last, the Hero Twins were able to challenge the Lords of Death and avenge their father, but their final victory allowed them to ascend to the heavens, where Xbalanque was immortalized as the moon, lighting the night for clever hunters everywhere.",

Barely clinging to dominance, the Flame Emperor deployed his greatest general, the warrior-poet Xing Tian. Tirelessly he battled the other would-be Emperors but the size of their armies were too great, their weapons too sharp. Xing Tian returned to his lord in defeat but with spirit unbroken. He begged to ride out and meet the enemy once more, but the Flame Emperor refused. His reign was over, his life forfeit to the Yellow Emperor.\\n\\nUnwilling to give in despite the loss of his lord, Xing Tian rallied the Flame Army for a final siege of the Yellow Emperor’s Sky Palace. While the soldiers crashed around them, Xing Tian met the Yellow Emperor in single combat, the two titans trading blows up the upon the mountaintop. High upon the snow-capped peak the Yellow Emperor’s blade struck true, beheading Xing Tian.\\n\\nWas it days that passed, or years? It is unknown, but there, at the base of the mountain, Xing Tian awoke. A new face burned from his chest. The fire to battle renewed, the now headless Xing Tian rose to fight again.\\n\\nFor Xing Tian there is no defeat; there is no death. As long as there is a battle to be fought he will never surrender. And he will never die.",

She is the mistress of all rivers and the eternal guardian of the ancient mysteries of life itself. Fishermen and sailors seek her blessings, for she is the protector of all who travel on water. Mothers-to-be ask for her aid, for she is the patron spirit of women and governs everything pertaining to the feminine – especially childbirth. After all, who better than the mother of all life to oversee its continuation?\\n\\nAs such, she considers herself the caretaker of all that lives. She cares deeply for all of her children, be they mortal or god, comforting them and cleansing them of their sorrows. At Yemoja’s blessed touch, wounds are healed and sickness is cured. \\n\\nBut even her kindness has its limits and should she be roused to anger, she becomes as violent and as destructive as the most turbulent of floodwaters. All who would dare stand against her are swept aside by her roaring fury. To challenge Yemoja is to challenge the river itself. But like the rivers, Yemoja has ever followed her own course.\\n\\nShe keeps to her spheres of influence and attends only those who seek out her blessings. Content in her solitude, she has maintained her distance from the affairs of the gods, for war does not interest her and she has power enough to suit her. But the advent of Olorun has changed things and even rivers must turn with the will of the heavens.\\n\\nAnd now, as her children cry out for aid, the river rises and Yemoja rises with it.",

Steam rose and froze again, and from that primordial mixture, Ymir, King of the Frost Giants took shape. From his body dripped other beings that would become the ancestors of Gods, Men, Dwarves, and of course, Giants. Even the mighty Odin must claim Ymir as his grandfather. Yet Ymir, like all giants, was an evil creature and led his Giant brethren against the Gods. After ages of warfare, Odin and his brothers slew the Giant-King and forged the world from his remains.\\n\\nYet there are other whispers. Rumors that Ymir, though not a God, was still a Primeval Being, and as such cannot truly be destroyed. Perhaps he only lies dormant in Niflheim, the realm of ice, eager to return and wreak vengeance upon Odin in his kin.",

  "Lore": "King of Gods, Zeus strives for fairness and justice, but will not hesitate to call down the thunder when there’s smiting to be done!\\n\\nZeus’ father, the Titan Cronus, immediately swallowed his children after birth so that none could overthrow him as he had his own father. When Zeus was born, Rhea, Zeus’ mother, hid the child from Cronus and gave the Titan a rock in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed instead. In secret, Zeus grew up on the isle of Crete until he was old and strong enough to challenge his father. During their battle, Zeus slit open Cronus’ stomach, allowing his swallowed brothers and sisters to escape, slaying the Titan. Then, Zeus released the Cyclops and other beings Cronus had kept imprisoned. In gratitude, the Cyclops awarded Zeus control over lightning.\\n\\nWith his two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, the three Gods drew lots to decide command of creation. Poseidon became king of the sea, Hades the underworld, and Zeus the sky. From his golden throne atop Mount Olympus, Zeus now rules Gods and Men with his wife Hera, upholding justice, hospitality, oaths, and honesty to all under his domain.\\n\\nYet, Zeus is a restless God, and while he holds high expectations for others, he does not keep those standards for himself. Chiefly, Zeus is nearly infamous for several infidelities to his wife which have resulted in dozens of children beget by other women, most famous of which are Hercules, Artemis, and Athena. Such wanton unfaithfulness is the source of great jealousy from Hera, though as King, Zeus can ultimately do as he wishes.\\n\\nWeather is dictated by the Thunder God’s mood. When in a fair temperament, the sky is clear, bright and warm. When Zeus’ anger flares, black clouds roll in, lightning streaks the sky and thunder shakes the very ground. Lately, Zeus has been furious.",

Zhong Kui was once a man with ambitions no greater than scholastic excellence, but in death became the perfect shield against evil’s onslaught.\\n\\nZhong Kui sought to pit his brilliant mind against the Imperial Examinations, tests to select councilors for the Emperor. With ease, he passed, but when the emperor saw his hideous face, he cast the scholar out. Offended, furious, Zhong Kui hurled himself repeatedly at the palace gates until his body was broken.\\n\\nFor his crime, Zhong Kui’s soul was judged by the King of Hell, but where the Emperor saw only ugliness, the King of Hell saw potential armed with genius. Zhong Kui was appointed Lord of Demons, tasked to forever hunt and ensnare the evils of the world.\\n\\nFor centuries, home owners and shopkeepers have adorned their buildings with Zhong Kui’s likeness, for that visage that once horrified the emperor now glares with purpose at unwelcome demons. Yet these days, it is not just shops and homes in peril, but the whole world. It does not take a mind like Zhong Kui’s to see evil’s hand in this War of the Gods. The time has come to bring these demons to task, and Zhong Kui means to smite them all.",
